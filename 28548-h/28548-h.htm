picture occupies the position it does in this book; and also to
the proprietor of the <i>Illustrated London News</i> for the
blocks to help forward my work, the pictures of which appeared in
his journal in November and December of last year and January in

<p>I must at the same time express my heart-felt thanks to the
manager and proprietors of the <i>Graphic</i> for the blocks
forming the illustrations on pages 1, 132, 170, 222, 228, 248,
272, 277, and which appeared in their journal on March 13th in
the present year, and which they have kindly presented to me to
help forward my object, connected with which sketches, at the
kind request of the Editor, I wrote the article.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">W. H. Overend</span>, Esq., was the artist
for the sketches in the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, and <span
class="smcap">Herbert Johnson</span>, Esq., was the artist for

<p>I also tender my warmest thanks to the Press generally for the
help rendered to me during the crusade so far, without which I
should have done but little.</p>

<p>I have taken the liberty of humbly dedicating this work to
you, the object of which is not to tickle the critical ears of
ethnologists and philologists, but to touch the hearts of my
countrymen on behalf of the poor Gipsy women and children and
other roadside Arabs flitting about in our midst, in such a way
as to command attention to these neglected, dark, marshy spots of
human life, whose seedlings have been running wild among us
during the last three centuries, spreading their poisonous
influence abroad, not only detrimental to the growth of
Christianity and the spread of civilisation, but to the present
and eternal welfare of the children; and, what I ask for is, that
the hand of the Schoolmaster may be extended towards the
children; and that the vans and other temporary and movable
abodes in which they live may be brought under the eye and
influence of the Sanitary Inspector.</p>

1</span>Part I.&mdash;Rambles in Gipsydom.</h2>
<p>The origin of the Gipsies, as to who they are; when they
became regarded as a peculiar race of wandering, wastrel,
ragamuffin vagabonds; the primary object they had in view in
setting out upon their shuffling, skulking, sneaking, dark
pilgrimage; whether they were driven at the point of the sword,
or allured onwards by the love of gold, designing dark deeds of
plunder, cruelty, and murder, or anxious to seek a haven of rest;
the route by which they travelled, whether over hill and dale, by
the side of the river and valley, skirting the edge of forest and
dell, delighting in the jungle, or pitching their tent in the
desert, following the shores of the ocean, or topping the
mountains; whether they were Indians, Persians, Egyptians,
Ishmaelites, Roumanians, Peruvians, Turks, Hungarians, Spaniards,
or Bohemians; the end of their destination; their religious
views&mdash;if any&mdash;their habits and modes of life have been
during the last three or four centuries wrapped, surrounded, and
encircled in mystery, according to some writers who have been
studying the Gipsy character.&nbsp; They have been a theme upon
which a &ldquo;bookworm&rdquo; could gloat, a chest of secret
drawers into which the curious delight to pry, a difficult
problem in Euclid for the mathematician to solve; and an
unreadable book for the author.&nbsp; A conglomeration of
languages for the <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>scholar, a puzzle for the historian,
and a subject for the novelist.&nbsp; These are points which it
is not the object of this book to attempt to clear up and settle;
all it aims at, as in the case of my &ldquo;Cry of the Children
from the Brick-yards of England,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Our Canal
Population,&rdquo; is, to tell &ldquo;A Dark Chapter in the
Annals of the Poor,&rdquo; little wanderers, houseless, homeless,
and friendless in our midst.&nbsp; At the same time it will be
necessary to take a glimpse at some of the leading features of
the historical part of their lives in order to get, to some
extent, a knowledge of the &ldquo;little ones&rdquo; whose
pitiable case I have ventured to take in hand.</p>
<p>Paint the words &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; and
&ldquo;secrecy&rdquo; upon any man&rsquo;s house, and you at once
make him a riddle for the cunning, envious, and crafty to try to
solve; and this has been the case with the Gipsies for
generations, and the consequence has been, they have trotted out
kings, queens, princes, bishops, nobles, ladies and gentlemen of
all grades, wise men, fools, and fanatics, to fill their coffers,
while they have been standing by laughing in their sleeves at the
foolishness of the foolish.</p>
<p>In Spain they were banished by repeated edicts under the
severest penalties.&nbsp; In Italy they were forbidden to remain
more than two nights in the same place.&nbsp; In Germany they
were shot down like wild beasts.&nbsp; In England during the
reign of Elizabeth, it was felony, without the &ldquo;benefit of
the clergy,&rdquo; to be seen in their company.&nbsp; The State
of Orleans decreed that they should be put to death with fire and
sword&mdash;still they kept coming.</p>
<p>In the last century, however, a change has come over several
of the European Governments.&nbsp; Maria Theresa in 1768, and
Charles III. of Spain in 1783, took measures for the education of
these poor outcasts in the habits of a civilised life with very
encouraging results.&nbsp; The experiment is now being tried in
Russia with signal success.&nbsp; The emancipation of the
Wallachian Gipsies is a fact accomplished, and the best results
are being achieved.</p>
<p><!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>The Gipsies have various names assigned to them in
different countries.&nbsp; The name of Bohemians was given to
them by the French, probably on account of their coming to France
from Bohemia.&nbsp; Some derive the word Bohemians from the old
French word &ldquo;Bo&euml;m,&rdquo; signifying a sorcerer.&nbsp;
The Germans gave them the name of &ldquo;Ziegeuner,&rdquo; or
wanderers.&nbsp; The Portuguese named them
&ldquo;Siganos.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Dutch called them
&ldquo;Heiden,&rdquo; or heathens.&nbsp; The Danes and Swedes,
&ldquo;Tartars.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Italy they are called
&ldquo;Zingari.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Turkey and the Levant,
&ldquo;Tschingenes.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Spain they are called
&ldquo;Gitanos.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Hungary and Transylvania, where
they are very numerous, they are called &ldquo;Pharaoh
Nepek,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pharaoh&rsquo;s People.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
notion of their being Egyptian is entirely erroneous&mdash;their
appearance, manners, and language being totally different from
those of either the Copts or Fellahs; there are many Gipsies now
in Egypt, but they are looked upon as strangers.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding that edicts have been hurled against them,
persecuted and hunted like vermin during the Middle Ages, still
they kept coming.&nbsp; Later on, laws more merciful than in
former times have taken a more humane view of them and been
contented by classing them as &ldquo;vagrants and
scoundrels&rdquo;&mdash;still they came.&nbsp; Magistrates,
ministers, doctors, and lawyers have spit their spite at
them&mdash;still they came; frowning looks, sour faces,
buttoned-up pockets, poverty and starvation staring them in the
face&mdash;still they came.&nbsp; Doors slammed in their faces,
dogs set upon their heels, and ignorant babblers hooting at
them&mdash;still they came; and the worst of it is they are
reducing our own &ldquo;riff-raff&rdquo; to their level.&nbsp;
The novelist has written about them; the preacher has preached
against them; the drunkards have garbled them over in their
mouths, and yelped out &ldquo;Gipsy,&rdquo; and stuttered
&ldquo;scamp&rdquo; in disgust; the swearer has sworn at them,
and our &ldquo;gutter-scum gentlemen&rdquo; have told them to
&ldquo;stand off.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
&ldquo;Jack-o&rsquo;-th&rsquo;-Lantern,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Will-o&rsquo;-th&rsquo;-Wisp,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Boo-peep,&rdquo; &ldquo;Moonshine Vagrants,&rdquo; <!--
page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>&ldquo;Ditchbank Sculks,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hedgerow
Rodneys,&rdquo; of whom there are not a few, are black spots upon
our horizon, and are ever and anon flitting before our
eyes.&nbsp; A motley crowd of half-naked savages, carrion eaters,
dressed in rags, tatters, and shreds, usually called men, women,
and children, some running, walking, loitering, traipsing,
shouting, gaping, and staring; the women with children on their
backs, and in their arms; old men and women tottering along
&ldquo;leaning upon their staffs;&rdquo; hordes of children
following in the rear; hulking men with lurcher dogs at their
heels, sauntering along in idleness, spotting out their prey;
donkeys loaded with sacks, mules with tents and sticks, and their
vans and waggons carrying ill-gotten gain and plunder; and the
question arises in the mind of those who take an interest in this
singularly unfortunate race of beings: From whence came
they?&nbsp; How have they travelled?&nbsp; By what routes did
they travel?&nbsp; What is their condition, past and
present?&nbsp; How are they to be dealt with in any efforts put
forth to improve their condition?&nbsp; These are questions I
shall in my feeble way endeavour to solve; at any rate, the two
latter questions; the first questions can be dealt better with by
abler hands than mine.</p>
<p>I would say, in the first place, that it is my decided
conviction that the Gipsies were neither more nor less, before
they set out upon their pilgrimage, than a pell-mell gathering of
many thousands of low-caste, good for nothing, idle Indians from
Hindustan&mdash;not ashamed to beg, with some amount of sentiment
in their nature, as exhibited in their musical tendencies and
love of gaudy colours, and except in rare instances, without any
true religious motives or influences.&nbsp; It may be worth while
to notice that I have come to the conclusion that they were
originally from India by observing them entirely in the light
given to me years ago of the different characters of human beings
both in Asia, Europe, and Africa.&nbsp; Their habits, manners,
and customs, to me, is a sufficient test, without calling in the
aid of the <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>philologist to decide the point of
their originality.&nbsp; I may here remark that in order to get
at the real condition of the Gipsies as they are at the present
day in this country, and not to have my mind warped or biassed in
any way, I purposely kept myself in ignorance upon the subject as
to what various authors have said either for or against them
until I had made my inquiries and the movement had been afloat
for several months.&nbsp; The first work touching the Gipsy
question I ever handled was presented to me by one of the
authors&mdash;Mr. Crofton&mdash;at the close of my Social Science
Congress paper read at Manchester last October, entitled
&ldquo;The Dialect of the English Gipsies,&rdquo; which work,
without any disrespect to the authors&mdash;and I know they will
overlook this want of respect&mdash;remained uncut for nearly two
months.&nbsp; With further reference to their Indian origin, the
following is an extract from &ldquo;Hoyland&rsquo;s Historical
Survey,&rdquo; in which the author says:&mdash;&ldquo;The Gipsies
have no writing peculiar to themselves in which to give a
specimen of the construction of their dialect.&nbsp; Music is the
only science in which the Gipsies participate in any considerable
degree; they likewise compose, but it is after the manner of the
Eastern people, extempore.&rdquo;&nbsp; Grellmann asserts that
the Hindustan language has the greatest affinity with that of the
Gipsies.&nbsp; He also infers from the following consideration
that Gipsies are of the lowest class of Indians, namely, Parias,
or, as they are called in Hindustan, Suders, and goes on to say
that the whole great nation of Indians is known to be divided
into four ranks, or stocks, which are called by a Portuguese
name, Castes, each of which has its own particular
sub-division.&nbsp; Of these castes, the Brahmins is the first;
the second contains the Tschechterias, or Setreas; the third
consists of the Beis, or Wazziers; the fourth is the caste of the
above-mentioned Suders, who, upon the peninsula of Malabar, where
their condition is the same as in Hindustan, are called Parias
and Pariers.&nbsp; The first were appointed by Brahma to seek
after knowledge, to give instruction, <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>and to take
care of religion.&nbsp; The second were to serve in war.&nbsp;
The third were, as the Brahmins, to cultivate science, but
particularly to attend to the breeding of cattle.&nbsp; The caste
of the Suders was to be subservient to the Brahmins, the
Tschechterias, and the Beis.&nbsp; These Suders, he goes on to
say, are held in disdain, and they are considered infamous and
unclean from their occupation, and they are abhorred because they
eat flesh; the three other castes living entirely on
vegetables.&nbsp; Baldeus says the Parias or Suders are a filthy
people and wicked crew.&nbsp; It is related in the &ldquo;Danish
Mission Intelligencer,&rdquo; nobody can deny that the Parias are
the dregs and refuse of all the Indians; they are thievish, and
have wicked dispositions.&nbsp; Neuhof assures us, &ldquo;the
Parias are full of every kind of dishonesty; they do not consider
lying and cheating to be sinful.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Gipsy&rsquo;s
solicitude to conceal his language is also a striking Indian
trait.&nbsp; Professor Pallas says of the Indians round Astracan,
custom has rendered them to the greatest degree suspicious about
their language.&nbsp; Salmon says that the nearest relations
cohabit with each other; and as to education, their children grow
up in the most shameful neglect, without either discipline or
instruction.&nbsp; The missionary journal before quoted says with
respect to matrimony among the Suders or Gipsies, &ldquo;they act
like beasts, and their children are brought up without restraint
or information.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Suders are fond of
horses, so are the Gipsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Grellmann goes on to say
&ldquo;that the Gipsies hunt after cattle which have died of
distempers in order to feed on them, and when they can procure
more of the flesh than is sufficient for one day&rsquo;s
consumption, they dry it in the sun.&nbsp; Such is the constant
custom with the Suders in India.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That the
Gipsies and natives of Hindustan resemble each other in
complexion and shape is undeniable.&nbsp; And what is asserted of
the young Gipsy girls rambling about with their fathers, who are
musicians, dancing with lascivious and indecent gesture to divert
any person who is willing to give them a small <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>gratuity for so
acting, is likewise perfectly Indian.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sonneratt
confirms this in the account he gives of the dancing girls of
Surat.&nbsp; Fortune-telling is practised all over the East, but
the peculiar kind professed by the Gipsies, viz., chiromancy,
constantly referring to whether the parties shall be rich or
poor, happy or unhappy in marriage, &amp;c., is nowhere met with
but in India.&nbsp; Sonneratt says:&mdash;&ldquo;The Indian smith
carries his tools, his shop, and his forge about with him, and
works in any place where he can find employment.&nbsp; He has a
stone instead of an anvil, and his whole apparatus is a pair of
tongs, a hammer, a beetle, and a file.&nbsp; This is very much
like Gipsy tinkers,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; It is usual for Parias,
or Suders, in India to have their huts outside the villages of
other castes.&nbsp; This is one of the leading features of the
Gipsies of this country.&nbsp; A visit to the outskirts of
London, where the Gipsies encamp, will satisfy any one upon this
point, viz., that our Gipsies are Indians.&nbsp; In isolated
cases a strong religious feeling has manifested itself in certain
persons of the Bunyan type of character and countenance&mdash;a
strong frame, with large, square, massive forehead, such as
Bunyan possessed; for it should be noted that John Bunyan was a
Gipsy tinker, with not an improbable mixture of the blood of an
Englishman in his veins, and, as a rule, persons of this mixture
become powerful for good or evil.&nbsp; A case in point, viz.,
Mrs. Simpson and her family, has come under my own observation
lately, which forcibly illustrates my meaning, both as regards
the evil Mrs. Simpson did in the former part of her life, and for
the last twenty years in her efforts to do good among persons of
her class, and also among others, as she has travelled about the
country.&nbsp; The exodus of the Gipsies from India may be set
down, first, to famine, of which India, as we all know, suffers
so much periodically; second, to the insatiable love of gold and
plunder bound up in the nature of the Gipsies&mdash;the West,
from an Indian point of view, is always looked upon as a land of
gold, flowing with milk and honey; third, the hatred the Gipsies
have for wars, <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>and as in the years of 1408 and 1409,
and many years previous to these dates, India experienced some
terrible bloody conflicts, when hundreds of thousands of men,
women, and children were butchered by the cruel monster Timur Beg
in cold blood, and during the tenth and eleventh centuries by
Mahmood the Demon, on purpose to make proselytes to the
Mohammedan faith, it is only natural to suppose that under those
circumstances the Gipsies would leave the country to escape the
consequences following those calamities, over-populated as it
was, numbering close upon 200,000,000 of human beings. <a
name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a>&nbsp; I am inclined to think that it
<!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>would be hunger and starvation upon their heels that
would be the propelling power to send them forward in quest of
food.&nbsp; From Attock, Peshawur, Cabul, and Herat, they would
tramp through Persia by Teheran, and enter the Euphrates Valley
at Bagdad.&nbsp; From Calcutta, Madras, Seringapatam, Bangalore,
Goa, Poonah, Hydrabad, Aurungabad, Nagpoor, Jabbulpoor, Benares,
Allahabad, Surat, Simla, Delhi, Lahore, they would wander along
to the mouth of the river Indus, and commence their journey at
Hydrabad, and travelling by the shores of the Indian Ocean,
stragglers coming in from Bunpore, Gombaroon, the commencement of
the Persian Gulf, when they would travel by Bushino to
Bassora.&nbsp; At this place they would begin to scatter
themselves over some parts of Arabia, making their headquarters
near Molah, Mecca, and other parts of the country, crossing over
Suez, and getting into Egypt in large numbers.&nbsp; Others would
take the Euphrates Valley route, which, by the way, is the route
of the proposed railway to India.&nbsp; Tribes branching off at
Kurnah, some to Bagdad, following the course of the river Tigris
to Mosul and Diarbeker, and others would go to Jerusalem,
Damuscus, and Antioch, till they arrived at Allepo and
Alexandretta.&nbsp; Here may be considered the starting-point
from which they spread over Asiatic Turkey in large numbers, till
they arrived before Constantinople at the commencement of the
fourteenth century.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>Straggling Gipsies no doubt found their way westward
prior to the wars of Timur Beg, and in this view I am supported
by the fact that two of our own countrymen&mdash;Fitz-Simeon and
Hugh the Illuminator, holy friars&mdash;on their pilgrimage to
the Holy Land in 1322, called at Crete, and there found some
Gipsies&mdash;I am inclined to think only a few sent out as a
kind of advance-guard or feeler, adopting the plan they have done
subsequently in peopling Europe and England during the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries.</p>
<p>Brand, in his observations in &ldquo;Popular
Antiquities,&rdquo; is of opinion also that the Gipsies fled from
Hindustan when Timur Beg ravaged India with a view of making
Mohammedans of the heathens, and it is calculated that during his
deeds of blood he butchered 500,000 Indians.&nbsp; Some writers
suppose that the Gipsies, in order to escape the sword of this
human monster, came into Europe through Egypt, and on this
account were called English Gipsies.</p>
<p>In a paper read by Colonel Herriot before the Royal Asiatic
Society, he says that the Gipsies, or Indians&mdash;called by
some Suders, by others Naths or Benia, the first signifying
rogue, the second dancer or tumbler&mdash;are to be met in large
numbers in that part of Hindustan which is watered by the Ganges,
as well as the Malwa, Gujerat, and the Deccan.</p>
<p>The religious crusades to the Holy Land commenced in the year
1095 and lasted to 1270.&nbsp; It was during the latter part of
the time of the Crusades, and prior to the commencement of the
wars by Timur Beg, that the Gipsies flocked by hundreds of
thousands to Asiatic Turkey.&nbsp; While the rich merchants and
princes were trying to outvie each other in their costly
equipages, grandeur, and display of gold in their pilgrimage to
the Holy Land, and the tremendous death-struggles between
Christianity, Idolatry, and Mohammedism, the Gipsies were busily
engaged in singing songs and plundering, and in this work they
were encouraged by the Persians as they passed through their
territory.&nbsp; The Persians have always been friendly to these
wandering, loafing Indians, for <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>we find that
during the wars of India by Timur Beg, and other monsters
previous, they were harbouring 20,000 of these poor low-caste and
outcast Indians; and, in fact, the same thing may be said of the
other countries they passed through on their way westward, for we
do not read of their being persecuted in these countries to
anything like the extent they have been in Europe.&nbsp; This, no
doubt, arises from the affinity there is between the Indian,
Persian, and Gipsy races, and the dislike the Europeans have
towards idlers, loafers, liars, and thieves; and especially is
this so in England.&nbsp; Gipsy life may find favour in the East,
but in the West the system cannot thrive.&nbsp; A real Englishman
hates the man who will not work, scorns the man who would tell
him a lie, and would give the thief who puts his hands into his
pocket the cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tails most unmercifully.&nbsp; The
persecutions of the Gipsies in this country from time to time has
been brought about, to a great extent, by themselves.&nbsp; John
Bull dislikes keeping the idle, bastard children of other
nations.&nbsp; He readily protects all those who tread upon
English soil, but in return for this kindness he expects them,
like bees, to be all workers.&nbsp; Drones, ragamuffins, and
rodneys cannot grumble if they get kicked out of the hive.&nbsp;
If 20,000 Englishmen were to tramp all over India, Turkey,
Persia, Hungary, Spain, America, Egypt, Greece, Cyprus, South
Africa, Germany, or France, in bands of from, say two to fifty
men, women, and children, in a most wretched; miserable
condition, doing little else but fiddling upon the national
conscience and sympathies, blood-sucking the hardworking
population, and frittering their time away in idleness,
pilfering, and filth, I expect, and justly so, the inhabitants
would begin to &ldquo;kick,&rdquo; and the place would no doubt
get rather warm for Mr. John Bull and his motley flock.&nbsp; If
the Gipsies, and others of the same class in this country, will
begin to &ldquo;buckle-to,&rdquo; and set themselves out for real
hard work, instead of cadging from door to door, they will find,
notwithstanding they are called Gipsies, John Bull <!-- page
12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>extending to them the hand of brotherhood and sympathy,
and the days of persecution passed.</p>
<p>One thing is remarkable concerning the Gipsies&mdash;we never
hear of their being actually engaged in warfare.&nbsp; They left
India for Asiatic Turkey before the great and terrible wars broke
out during the fourteenth century, and before the great religious
wars concerning the Mohammedan faith in Turkey, during the
fourteenth century, they fled to Western Europe.&nbsp; Thus it
will be seen that they &ldquo;would sooner run a mile than fight
a minute.&rdquo;&nbsp; The idea of cold steel in open day
frightens them out of their wits.&nbsp; Whenever a war is about
to take place in the country in which they are located they will
begin to make themselves scarce; and, on the other hand, they
will not visit a country where war is going on till after it is
over, and then, vulture-like, they swoop down upon the
prey.&nbsp; This feature is one of their leading characteristics;
with some honourable exceptions, they are always looked upon as
long-sighted, dark, deep, designing specimens of fallen
humanity.&nbsp; For a number of years prior to the capture of
Constantinople by Mohammed II. in 1453 the Gipsies had commenced
to wend their way to various parts of Europe.&nbsp; The 200,000
Gipsies who had emigrated to Wallachia and Moldavia, their
favourite spot and stronghold, saw what was brewing, and had
begun to divide themselves into small bands.&nbsp; A band of 300
of these wanderers, calling themselves Secani, appeared in 1417
at L&uuml;neburg, and in 1418 at Basil and Bern in
Switzerland.&nbsp; Some were seen at Augsberg on November 1,
1418.&nbsp; Near to Paris there were to be seen numbers of
Gipsies in 1424, 1426, and 1427; but it is not likely they
remained long in Paris.&nbsp; Later on we find them at Arnheim in
1429, and at Metz in 1430, Erfurt in 1432, and in Bavaria in
1433.&nbsp; The reason they appeared at these places at those
particular times, was, no doubt, owing to the internal troubles
of France; for it was during 1429 that Joan of Arc raised the
siege of Orleans.&nbsp; The Gipsies appearing <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>in small
bands in various parts of the Continent at this particular time
were, no doubt, as Mr. Groom says in his article in the
&ldquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica,&rdquo; sent forward by the
main body of Gipsies left behind in Asiatic and European Turkey,
to spy out the land whither they were anxious to bend their ways;
for it was in the year 1438, fifteen years before the terrible
struggle by the Mohammedans for Constantinople, that the great
exodus of Gipsies from Wallachia, Roumania, and Moldavia, for the
golden cities of the West commenced.&nbsp; From the period of
1427 to 1514, a space of about eighty-seven years&mdash;except
spies&mdash;they were content to remain on the Continent without
visiting our shores; probably from two causes&mdash;first, their
dislike to crossing the water; second, the unsettled state of our
own country during this period.&nbsp; For it should be remembered
that the Wars of the Roses commenced in 1455, Richard III. was
killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field, and in 1513 the Battle of
Flodden took place in Scotland, in which the Scots were
defeated.&nbsp; The first appearance of the Gipsies in large
numbers in Great Britain was in Scotland in 1514, the year after
the Battle of Flodden.&nbsp; Another remarkable coincidence
connected with their appearance in this country came out during
my inquiries; but whether there is any foundation for it further
than it is an idea floating in my brain I have not yet been able
to ascertain, as nothing is mentioned of it in any of the
writings I have perused.&nbsp; It seems reasonable to suppose
that the Gipsies, would retain and hand down some of their
pleasant, as well as some of the bitter, recollections of India,
which, no doubt, would at this time be mentioned to persons high
in position&mdash;it should be noted that the Gipsies at this
time were favourably received at certain head-quarters amongst
merchants and princes&mdash;for we find that within fourteen
years after the landing of the Indians upon our shores attempts
were made to reach India by the North-east and North-west
passages, which proved a disastrous affair.&nbsp; Then, again, in
1579 Sir F. Drake&rsquo;s expedition set out <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>for
India.&nbsp; In 1589 the Levant Company made a land expedition,
and in all probability followed the track by which the Gipsies
travelled from India to the Holy Land in the fourteenth century,
by the Euphrates valley and Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the year 1417, in the Hanseatic towns on
the Baltic coast and at the mouth of the Elbe, there appeared
before the gates of L&uuml;neburg, and later on at Hamburg,
L&uuml;beck, Wirmar, Rostock, and Stralsuna, a herd of swarthy
and strange specimens of humanity, uncouth in form, hideous in
complexion, and their whole exterior shadowed forth the lowest
depths of poverty and degradation.&nbsp; A cloak made of the
fragments of oriental finery was generally used to disguise the
filth and tattered garments of their slight remaining
apparel.&nbsp; The women and young children travelled in rude
carts drawn by asses or mules; the men trudged alongside, casting
fierce and suspicious glances on those they met, thief-like, from
underneath their low, projecting foreheads and eyebrows; the
elder children, unkempt and half-clad, swarmed in every
direction, calling with shrill cries and monkey-like faces and
grimaces to the passers-by to their feats of jugglery, craft, and
deception.&nbsp; Forsaking the Baltic provinces the dusky band
then sought a more friendly refuge in central Germany&mdash;and
it was quite time they had begun to make a move, for their deeds
of darkness had oozed out, and a number of them paid the penalty
upon the gallows, and the rest scampered off to Meissen, Leipsic,
and Herse.&nbsp; At these places they were not long in letting
the inhabitants know, by their depredations, witchcraft, devilry,
and other abominations, the class of people they had in their
midst, and the result was their speedy banishment from Germany;
and in 1418, after wandering about for a few months only, they
turned their steps towards Switzerland, reaching Zurich on August
1st, and encamped during six days before the town, exciting much
sympathy by their pious tale and sorrowful appearance.&nbsp; In
Switzerland the <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>inhabitants were more gullible, and
the soft parts of their nature were easily getatable, and the
consequence was the Gipsies made a good thing of it for the space
of four years.&nbsp; Soon after leaving Zurich, according to Dr.
Mikliosch, the wanderers divided their forces.&nbsp; One
detachment crossed the Botzberg and created quite a panic amongst
the peaceable inhabitants of Sisteron, who, fearing and imagining
all sorts of evils from these satanic-looking people, fed them
with a hundred loaves, and induced them, for the good of their
health, to make themselves miserably less.&nbsp; We next hear of
them in Italy, in 1422.&nbsp; After leaving Asiatic Turkey, and
in their wanderings through Russia and Germany, the Asiatic,
sanctimonious, religious halo, borrowed from their idolatrous
form and notions of the worship of God in the East, had suffered
much from exposure to the civilising and Christianising
influences of the West; and the result was their leaders decided
to make a pilgrimage to Rome to regain, under the cloak of
religion, some of the self-imagined lost prestige; and in this
they were, at any rate, for a time, successful.&nbsp; On the 11th
day of July, 1422, a leader of the Gipsies, named Duke Andrew,
arrived at Bologna, with men, women and children, fully one
hundred persons, carrying with them, as they alleged, a decree
signed by the King of Hungary, permitting them, owing to their
return to the Christian faith&mdash;stating at the same time that
4,000 had been re-baptised&mdash;to rob without penalty or
hindrance wherever they travelled during seven years.&nbsp; Here
these long-faced, pious hypocrites were in clover, as a reward
for their professed re-embracing Christianity.&nbsp; After the
expiration of this term they told the open-mouthed inhabitants,
as a kind of sweetener, that they were to present themselves to
the Pope, and then return to India&mdash;aye, with the spoils of
their lying campaign, gained by robbing and plundering all they
came in contact with.&nbsp; The result of their deceitful, lying
expedition to Rome was all they could wish, and they received a
fresh passport from <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>. the Pope, asking for alms from his
faithful flock on behalf of these wretches, who have been
figuring before western nations of the world&mdash;sometimes as
kings, counts, martyrs, prophets, witches, thieves, liars, and
murderers; sometimes laying their misfortunes at the door of the
King of Egypt, the Sultan of Turkey, religious persecution in
India, the King of Hungary, and a thousand other Gorgios since
them.&nbsp; Sometimes they would appear as renegade Christians,
converted heathens, Roman Catholics, in fact, they have been
everything to everybody; and, so long as the &ldquo;grist was
coming to the mill,&rdquo; it did not matter how or by whom it
came.</p>
<p>By an ordinance of the State of Orleans in the year 1560 it
was enjoined that all those impostors and vagabonds who go
tramping about under the name of Bohemians and Egyptians should
quit the kingdom, on penalty of the galleys.&nbsp; Upon this they
dispersed into lesser companies, and spread themselves over
Europe.&nbsp; They were expelled from Spain in 1591.&nbsp; The
first time we hear of them in England in the public records was
in the year 1530, when they were described by the statute 22 Hen.
VIII., cap. 10, as &ldquo;an outlandish people calling themselves
Egyptians.&nbsp; Using no craft nor seat of merchandise, who have
come into this realm and gone from shire to shire, and place to
place, in great company, and used great subtile, crafty means to
deceive the people, bearing them in hand, that they by palmistry
could tell men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s fortunes, and so many
times by craft and subtilty have deceived the people of their
money, and also have committed many heinous felonies and
robberies.&nbsp; Wherefore they are directed to avoid the realm,
and not to return under pain of imprisonment and forfeiture of
their goods and chattels; and upon their trials for any felony
which they may have committed they shall not be entitled to a
jury <i>de medietate lingu&aelig;</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; As if the
above enactment was not sufficiently strong to prevent these
wretched people multiplying in our midst and carrying on their
abominable practices, <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>it was afterwards enacted by statutes
1 and 2 Ph., and in c. 4 and 5 Eliz., cap. 20, &ldquo;that if any
such person shall be imported into this kingdom, the importer
shall forfeit &pound;40.&nbsp; And if the Egyptians themselves
remain one month in this kingdom, or if any person being fourteen
years old (whether natural-born subject or stranger), which hath
been seen or found in the fellowship of such Egyptians, or which
hath disguised him or herself like them, shall remain in the same
one month, or if several times it is felony, without the benefit
of the clergy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Matthew Hale informs us that at the Suffolk Assizes no
less than thirteen Gipsies were executed upon these statutes a
few years before the Restoration.&nbsp; But to the honour of our
national humanity&mdash;which at the time of these executions
could only have been in name and not in reality, for those were
the days of bull-fighting, bear-baiting, and like sports, the
practice of which in those dark ages was thought to be the
highest pitch of culture and refinement&mdash;no more instances
of this kind were thrown into the balance, for the public
conscience had become somewhat awakened; the days of
enlightenment had begun to dawn, for by statute 23, George III.,
cap. 51, it was enacted that the Act of Eliz., cap. 20, is
repealed; and the statute 17 George II., cap. 5, regards them
under the denomination of &ldquo;rogues and vagabonds;&rdquo; and
such is the title given to them at the present day by the law of
the land&mdash;&ldquo;Rogues and Vagabonds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow, in page 10 of his &ldquo;Bible in Spain,&rdquo; says:
&ldquo;Shortly after their first arrival in England, which is
upwards of three centuries since, a dreadful persecution was
raised against them, the aim of which was their utter
extermination&mdash;the being a Gipsy was esteemed a crime worthy
of death, and the gibbets of England groaned and creaked beneath
the weight of Gipsy carcases, and the miserable survivors were
literally obliged to creep into the earth in order to preserve
their lives.&nbsp; But these days passed by; their persecutors
became weary of persecuting them; they <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>showed their
heads from the caves where they had hidden themselves; they
ventured forth increased in numbers, and each tribe or family
choosing a particular circuit, they fairly divided the land
amongst them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In England the male Gipsies are all dealers in horses
[this is not exactly the case with the Gipsies of the present
day], and sometimes employ their time in mending the tin and
copper utensils of the peasantry; the females tell
fortunes.&nbsp; They generally pitch their tents in the vicinity
of a village or small town, by the roadside, under the shelter of
the hedges and trees.&nbsp; The climate of England is well known
to be favourable to beauty, and in no part of the world is the
appearance of the Gipsies so prepossessing as in that
country.&nbsp; Their complexion is dark, but not disagreeably so;
their faces are oval, their features regular, their foreheads
rather low, and their hands and feet small.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crimes of which these people were originally
accused were various, but the principal were theft, sorcery, and
causing disease among the cattle; and there is every reason for
supposing that in none of these points they were altogether
guiltless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With respect to sorcery, a thing in itself impossible,
not only the English Gipsies, but the whole race, have ever
professed it; therefore, whatever misery they may have suffered
on that account they may be considered as having called it down
upon their own heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dabbling in sorcery is in some degree the province of
the female Gipsy.&nbsp; She affects to tell the future, and to
prepare philters by means of which love can be awakened in any
individual towards any particular object; and such is the
credulity of the human race, even in the more enlightened
countries, that the profits arising from their practices are
great.&nbsp; The following is a case in point:&mdash;Two females,
neighbours and friends, were tried some years since in England
for the murder of their husbands.&nbsp; It appeared that they
were in love with the same individual, and <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>had
conjointly, at various times, paid sums of money to a Gipsy woman
to work charms to captivate his affection.&nbsp; Whatever little
effect the charm might produce, they were successful in their
principal object, for the person in question carried on for some
time a criminal intercourse with both.&nbsp; The matter came to
the knowledge of the husbands, who, taking means to break off
this connection, were respectively poisoned by their wives.&nbsp;
Till the moment of conviction these wretched females betrayed
neither emotion nor fear; but then their consternation was
indescribable, when they afterwards confessed that the Gipsy who
had visited them in prison had promised to shield them from
conviction by means of her art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poisoning cattle is exercised by them in two ways: by
one, they merely cause disease in the animals, with the view of
receiving money for curing them upon offering their
services.&nbsp; The poison is generally administered by powders
cast at night into the mangers of the animals.&nbsp; This way is
only practised upon the larger cattle, such as horses and
cows.&nbsp; By the other, which they practise chiefly on swine,
speedy death is almost invariably produced, the drug administered
being of a highly intoxicating nature, and affecting the
brain.&nbsp; Then they apply at the house or farm where the
disaster has occurred for the carcase of the animal, which is
generally given them without suspicion, and then they feast on
the flesh, which is not injured by the poison, it only affecting
the head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In looking at the subject from a plain, practical,
common-sense point of view&mdash;divested of
&ldquo;opinions,&rdquo; &ldquo;surmises,&rdquo;
&ldquo;technicalities,&rdquo; &ldquo;similarities,&rdquo; certain
ethnological false shadows and philological mystifications, the
little glow-worm in the hedge-bottom on a dark night, which our
great minds have been running after for generations, and
&ldquo;natural consequences,&rdquo; &ldquo;objects sought,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;certain results&rdquo;&mdash;we shall find that the
same thing has happened to the Gipsies, or Indians, centuries
ago, that has happened to all nations at one <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>time or
other.&nbsp; There can be no doubt but that terrible internal
struggles took place, and hundreds of thousands of the
inhabitants were butchered in cold blood, in India, during the
tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries; there can be
no question, also, that the 200,000,000 inhabitants, in this
over-populated country, would suffer, in various forms, the
direst consequences of war, famine, and bloodshed; and, it is
more than probable, that hundreds of thousands of the idle,
low-caste Indians, too lazy to work, too cowardly to fight in
open day, with no honourable ambition or true religious instincts
in their nature, other than to aspire to the position similar to
bands of Nihilists, Communists, Socialists, or Fenians of the
present day, would emigrate to Wallachia, Roumania, or Moldavia,
which countries, at that day, were looked upon as England is at
the present time.&nbsp; The Gipsies, many centuries ago, as now,
did not believe in yokes being placed round their necks.&nbsp;
The fact of 200,000 of these emigrants, about whom, after all,
there is not much mystery, emigrating to Wallachia in such large
numbers, proves to my mind that there was a greater power behind
them and before them than is usually supposed to be the case, and
than that attending wandering minstrels, impelling them
forward.&nbsp; Mohammedism, soldiers, and death would not be
looked upon by the Gipsies as pleasant companions.&nbsp; By
fleeing for their lives they escaped death, and Wallachia was to
the Gipsies, for some time, what America has been to the
Fenians&mdash;an ark of safety and the land of Nod.&nbsp; Many of
the Gipsies themselves imagine that they are the descendants of
Ishmael, from the simple fact that it was decreed by God, they
say, that his descendants should wander about in tents, and they
were to be against everybody, and everybody against them.&nbsp;
This erroneous impression wants removing, or the Gipsies will
never rise in position.</p>
<p>In no country in the world is there so much caste feeling,
devilish jealousy, and diabolical revenge manifested as in <!--
page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>India.&nbsp; These are true types and traits of Indian
character, especially of the lower orders and those who have lost
caste; the Turks, Arabs, Egyptians, Roumanians, Hungarians, and
Spaniards sink into insignificance when compared with the
Afghans, Hindus, and other inhabitants of some of the worst parts
of India.&nbsp; Any one observing the Gipsies closely, as I have
been trying to do for some time, outside their mystery boxes,
with their thin, flimsy veil of romance and superstitious turn of
their faces, will soon discover their Indian character.&nbsp; Of
course their intermixture with Circassians and other nations, in
the course of their travels from India, during five or six
centuries, till the time they arrived at our doors, has brought,
and is still bringing, to the surface the blighted flowers of
humanity, whose ancestral tree derived its nourishment from the
soil of Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Greece, Roumania, Wallachia,
Moldavia, Spain, Hungary, Norway, Italy, Germany, France,
Switzerland, England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, as the muddy
stream of Gipsyism has been winding its way for ages through
various parts of the world; and, I am sorry to say, this little
dark stream has been casting forth an unpleasant odour and a
horrible stench in our midst, which has so long been fed and
augmented by the dregs of English society from Sunday-schools and
the hearthstones of pious parents.&nbsp; The different
nationalities to be seen among the Gipsies, in their camps and
tents, may be looked upon as so many bastard off-shoots from the
main trunk of the trees that have been met with in their
wanderings.</p>
<p>In no part of the globe, owing principally to our isolation,
is the old Gipsy character losing itself among the street-gutter
rabble as in our own; notwithstanding this mixture of blood and
races, the diabolical Indian elements are easily recognisable in
their wigwams.&nbsp; Then, again, their Indian origin can be
traced in many of their social habits; among others, they squat
upon the ground differently to the Turk, Arab, and other
nationalities, who are pointed to by some writers <!-- page
22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>as
being the ancestors of the Gipsies.&nbsp; Their tramping over the
hills and plains of India, and exposure to all the changes of the
climate, has no doubt fitted them, physically, for the kind of
life they are leading in various parts of the world.&nbsp; To-day
Gipsies are to be found in almost every part of the civilised
countries, between the frozen regions of Siberia and the burning
sands of Africa, squatting about in their tents.&nbsp; The
treatment of the women and children by the men corresponds
exactly with the treatment the women and children are receiving
at the hands of the low-caste Indians.&nbsp; The Arabian women,
the Turkish women, and Egyptian women, may be said to be queens
when set up in comparison with the poor Gipsy woman in this
country.&nbsp; In Turkey, Arabia, Egypt, and some other Eastern
nations, the women are kept in the background; but among the
low-caste Indians and Gipsies the women are brought to the front
divested of the modesty of those nations who claim to be the
primogenitors of the Gipsy tribes and races.&nbsp; Among the
lower orders of Indians, from whom the Gipsies are the outcome,
most extraordinary types of characters and countenances are to be
seen.&nbsp; Any one visiting the Gipsy wigwams of the present day
will soon discover the relationship.</p>
<p>In early life, as among the Indians, some of the girls are
pretty and interesting, but with exposure, cruelty, immorality,
debauchery, idle and loose habits, the pretty, dark-eyed girl
soon becomes the coarse, vulgar woman, with the last trace of
virtue blown to the winds.&nbsp; If any one with but little keen
sense of observation will peep into a Gipsy&rsquo;s tent when the
man is making pegs and skewers, and contrast him with the
low-caste Indian potter at his wheel and the carpenter at his
bench&mdash;all squatting upon the ground&mdash;he will not be
long in coming to the conclusion that they are all pretty much of
the same family.</p>
<p>Ethnologists and philologists may find certain words used by
the Gipsies to correspond with the Indian language, and this adds
another proof to those I have already adduced; <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>but, to my
mind, this, after the lapse of so many centuries, considering all
the changes that have taken place since the Gipsies emigrated, is
not the most convincing argument, any more than our forms of
letters, the outcome of hieroglyphics, prove that we were once
Egyptians.&nbsp; No doubt, there are a certain few words used by
all nations which, if their roots and derivations were thoroughly
looked into, a similarity would be found in them.&nbsp; As
America, Australia, New Zealand, and Africa have been fields for
emigrants from China and Europe during the last century, so, in
like manner, Europe was the field for certain low-caste poor
emigrants from India during the two preceding centuries, with
this difference&mdash;the emigrants from India to Europe were
idlers, loafers who sought to make their fortunes among the
Europeans by practising, without work, the most subtle arts of
double-dealing, lying, deception, thieving, and dishonesty, and
the fate that attends individuals following out such a course as
this has attended the Gipsies in all their wanderings; the
consequence has been, the Gipsy emigrants, after their first
introduction to the various countries, have, by their actions,
disgusted those whom they wished to cheat and rob, hence the
treatment they have received.&nbsp; This cannot be said of the
emigrant from England to America and our own or other
colonies.&nbsp; An English emigrant, on account of his open
conduct, straightforward character, and industry, has been always
respected.&nbsp; In any country an English emigrant enters, owing
to his industrious habits, an improvement takes place.&nbsp; In
the country where an Indian emigrant of the Gipsy tribe enters
the tendency is the reverse of this, so far as their influence is
concerned&mdash;downward to the ground and to the dogs they
go.&nbsp; In these two cases the difference between civilisation
and Christianity and heathenism comes out to a marked degree.</p>
<p>In a leading article in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, July,
1878, upon the origin and wanderings of the Gipsies, the
following <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>appears:&mdash;&ldquo;We next
encounter them in Corfu, probably before 1346, since there is
good reason to believe them to be indicated under the name of
<i>homines vageniti</i> in a document emanating from the Empress
Catharine of Valois, who died in that year; certainly, about
1370, when they were settled upon a fief recognised as the
<i>feudum Acinganorum</i> by the Venetians, who, in 1386,
succeeded to the right of the House of Valois in the
island.&nbsp; This fief continued to subsist under the lordship
of the Barons de Abitabulo and of the House of Prosalendi down to
the abolition of feudalism in Corfu in the beginning of the
present century.&nbsp; There remain to be noted two important
pieces of evidence relating to this period.&nbsp; The first is
contained in a charter of Miracco I., Waiwode of Wallachia, dated
1387, renewing a grant of forty &lsquo;tents&rsquo; of Gipsies,
made by his uncle, Ladislaus, to the monastery of St. Anthony of
Vodici.&nbsp; Ladislaus began to reign in 1398.&nbsp; The second
consists in the confirmation accorded in 1398 by the Venetian
governor of Nanplion of the privileges extended by his
predecessors to the Acingani dwelling in that district.&nbsp;
Thus we find Gipsies wandering through Crete in 1322, settled in
Corfu from 1346, enslaved in Wallachia about 1370, protected in
the Peloponnesus before 1398.&nbsp; Nor is there is any reason to
believe that their arrival in those countries was a recent
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Niebuhr, in his travels through Arabia, met with hordes of
these strolling Gipsies in the warm district of Yemen, and M.
Sauer in like manner found them established in the frozen regions
of Siberia.&nbsp; His account of them, published in 1802, shows
the Gipsy to be the same in Northern Russia as with us in
England.&nbsp; He describes them as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;I was
surprised at the appearance of detached families throughout the
Government of Tobolsk, and upon inquiry I learned that several
roving companies of these people had strolled into the city of
Tobolsk.&rdquo;&nbsp; The governor thought of establishing a
colony of them, but they were too cunning for <!-- page 25--><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>the simple
Siberian peasant.&nbsp; He placed them on a footing with the
peasants, and allotted a portion of land for cultivation with a
view of making them useful members of society.&nbsp; They
rejected houses even in this severe climate, and preferred open
tents or sheds.&nbsp; In Hungary and Transylvania they dwell in
tents during the summer, and for their winter quarters make holes
ten or twelve feet deep in the earth.&nbsp; The women, one writer
says, &ldquo;deal in old clothes, prostitution, wanton dances,
and fortune-telling, and are indolent beggars and thieves.&nbsp;
They have few disorders except the measles and small-pox, and
weaknesses in their eyes caused by the smoke.&nbsp; Their physic
is saffron put into their soup, with bleeding.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
Hungary, as with other nations, they have no sense of religion,
though with their usual cunning and hypocrisy they profess the
established faith of every country in which they live.</p>
<p>The following is an article taken from the <i>Saturday
Review</i>, December 13th, 1879:&mdash;&ldquo;It has been
repeated until the remark has become accepted as a sort of truism
that the Gipsies are a mysterious race, and that nothing is known
of their origin.&nbsp; And a few years ago this was true; but
within those years so much has been discovered that at present
there is really no more mystery attached to the beginning of
those nomads than is peculiar to many other peoples.&nbsp; What
these discoveries or grounds of belief are we shall proceed to
give briefly, our limits not permitting the detailed citation of
authorities.&nbsp; First, then, there appears to be every reason
for believing with Captain Richard Burton that the Jats of
North-Western India furnished so large a proportion of the
emigrants or exiles who, from the tenth century, went out of
India westward, that there is very little risk in assuming it as
an hypothesis, at least, that they formed the <i>Hauptstamm</i>
of the Gipsies of Europe.&nbsp; What other elements entered into
these, with whom we are all familiar, will be considered
presently.&nbsp; These Gipsies came from India, where caste is
established and callings are <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>hereditary
even among out-castes.&nbsp; It is not assuming too much to
suppose that, as they evinced a marked aptitude for certain
pursuits and an inveterate attachment to certain habits, their
ancestors had in these respects resembled them for ages.&nbsp;
These pursuits and habits were, that:&mdash;They were tinkers,
smiths, and farriers.&nbsp; They dealt in horses, and were
naturally familiar with them.&nbsp; They were without
religion.&nbsp; They were unscrupulous thieves.&nbsp; Their women
were fortune-tellers, especially by chiromancy.&nbsp; They ate
without scruple animals which had died a natural death, being
especially fond of the pig, which, when it has thus been
&lsquo;butchered by God,&rsquo; is still regarded even by the
most prosperous Gipsies in England as a delicacy.&nbsp; They
flayed animals, carried corpses, and showed such aptness for
these and similar detested callings that in several European
countries they long monopolised them.&nbsp; They made and sold
mats, baskets, and small articles of wood.&nbsp; They have shown
great skill as dancers, musicians, singers, acrobats; and it is a
rule almost without exception that there is hardly a travelling
company of such performers, or a theatre in Europe or America, in
which there is not at least one person with some Romany
blood.&nbsp; Their hair remains black to advanced age, and they
retain it longer than do Europeans or ordinary Orientals.&nbsp;
They speak an Aryan tongue, which agrees in the main with that of
the Jats, but which contains words gathered from other Indian
sources.&nbsp; Admitting these as the peculiar pursuits of the
race, the next step should be to consider what are the principal
nomadic tribes of Gipsies in India and Persia, and how far their
occupations agree with those of the Romany of Europe.&nbsp; That
the Jats probably supplied the main stock has been
admitted.&nbsp; This was a bold race of North-Western India which
at one time had such power as to obtain important victories over
the caliphs.&nbsp; They were broken and dispersed in the eleventh
century by Mahmoud, many thousands of them wandering to the
West.&nbsp; They were without religion, <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>&lsquo;of the
horse, horsey,&rsquo; and notorious thieves.&nbsp; In this they
agree with the European Gipsy.&nbsp; But they are not habitual
eaters of <i>mullo balor</i>, or &lsquo;dead pork;&rsquo; they do
not devour everything like dogs.&nbsp; We cannot ascertain that
the Jat is specially a musician, a dancer, a mat and
basket-maker, a rope-dancer, a bear-leader, or a pedlar.&nbsp; We
do not know whether they are peculiar in India among the Indians
for keeping their hair unchanged to old age, as do pure-blood
English Gipsies.&nbsp; All of these things are, however, markedly
characteristic of certain different kinds of wanderers, or
Gipsies, in India.&nbsp; From this we
conclude&mdash;hypothetically&mdash;that the Jat warriors were
supplemented by other tribes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next to the word Rom itself, the most interesting in
Romany is Zingan, or Tchenkan, which is used in twenty or thirty
different forms by the people of every country, except England,
to indicate the Gipsy.&nbsp; An incredible amount of far-fetched
erudition has been wasted in pursuing this philological
<i>ignis-fatuus</i>.&nbsp; That there are leather-working and
saddle-working Gipsies in Persia who call themselves Zingan is a
fair basis for an origin of the word; but then there are Tchangar
Gipsies of Jat affinity in the Punjab.&nbsp; Wonderful it is that
in this war of words no philologist has paid any attention to
what the Gipsies themselves say about it.&nbsp; What they do say
is sufficiently interesting, as it is told in the form of a
legend which is intrinsically curious and probably ancient.&nbsp;
It is given as follows in &lsquo;The People of Turkey,&rsquo; by
a Consul&rsquo;s Daughter and Wife, edited by Mr. Stanley Lane
Poole, London, 1878:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Although the Gipsies are not
persecuted in Turkey, the antipathy and disdain felt for them
evinces itself in many ways, and appears to be founded upon a
strange legend current in the country.&nbsp; This legend says
that when the Gipsy nation were driven out of their country and
arrived at Mekran, they constructed a wonderful machine to which
a wheel was attached.&rsquo;&nbsp; From the context of this
imperfectly <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>told story, it would appear as if the
Gipsies could not travel further until this wheel should
revolve:&mdash;&lsquo;Nobody appeared to be able to turn it, till
in the midst of their vain efforts some evil spirit presented
himself under the disguise of a sage, and informed the chief,
whose name was Chen, that the wheel would be made to turn only
when he had married his sister Guin.&nbsp; The chief accepted the
advice, the wheel turned round, and the name of the tribe after
this incident became that of the combined names of the brother
and sister, Chenguin, the appellation of all the Gipsies of
Turkey at the present day.&rsquo;&nbsp; The legend goes on to
state that, in consequence of this unnatural marriage, the
Gipsies were cursed and condemned by a Mohammedan saint to wander
for ever on the face of the earth.&nbsp; The real meaning of the
myth&mdash;for myth it is&mdash;is very apparent.&nbsp; Chen is a
Romany word, generally pronounced Chone, meaning the moon, while
Guin is almost universally rendered <i>Gan</i> or
<i>Kan</i>.&nbsp; <i>Kan</i> is given by George Borrow as meaning
sun, and we have ourselves heard English Gipsies call it
<i>kan</i>, although <i>kam</i> is usually assumed to be
right.&nbsp; Chen-kan means, therefore, moon-sun.&nbsp; And it
may be remarked in this connection that the Roumanian Gipsies
have a wild legend stating that the sun was a youth who, having
fallen in love with his own sister, was condemned as the sun to
wander for ever in pursuit of her turned into the moon.&nbsp; A
similar legend exists in Greenland and the island of Borneo, and
it was known to the old Irish.&nbsp; It was very natural that the
Gipsies, observing that the sun and moon were always apparently
wandering, should have identified their own nomadic life with
that of these luminaries.&nbsp; It may be objected by those to
whom the term &lsquo;solar myth&rsquo; is as a red rag that this
story, to prove anything, must first be proved itself.&nbsp; This
will probably not be far to seek.&nbsp; If it can be found among
any of the wanderers in India, it may well be accepted, until
something better turns up, as the possible origin of the greatly
disputed Zingan.&nbsp; It is quite <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>as plausible
as Dr. Mikliosch&rsquo;s derivation from the Acingani&mdash;
&#787;&Alpha;&tau;&sigma;&#943;y&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&iota;&mdash;&lsquo;an
unclean, heretical Christian sect, who dwelt in Phrygia and
Lycaonia from the seventh till the eleventh century.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The mention of Mekran indicates clearly that the moon-sun story
came from India before the Romany could have obtained any Greek
name.&nbsp; And if the Romany call themselves Jengan, or Chenkan,
or Zin-gan, in the East, it is extremely unlikely that they ever
received such a name from the Gorgios in Europe.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Professor Bott, in his &ldquo;Die Zigeuner in Europa und
Asien,&rdquo; speaks of the Gipsies or <i>L&uuml;ry</i> as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;In the great Persian epic, the
&lsquo;Shah-Nameh&rsquo;&mdash;in &lsquo;Book of Kings,&rsquo;
Firdusi&mdash;relates an historical tradition to the following
effect.&nbsp; About the year 420 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>,
Behr&acirc;m G&ucirc;r, a wise and beneficent ruler of the
Sassanian dynasty, finding that his poorer subjects languished
for lack of recreation, bethought himself of some means by which
to divert their spirits amid the oppressive cares of a laborious
life.&nbsp; For this purpose he sent an embassy to Shankal, King
of Canaj and Maharajah of India, with whom he had entered into a
strict bond of amity, requesting him to select from among his
subjects and transmit to the dominions of his Persian ally such
persons as could by their arts help to lighten the burden of
existence, and lend a charm to the monotony of toil.&nbsp; The
result was the importation of twelve thousand minstrels, male and
female, to whom the king assigned certain lands, as well as an
ample supply of corn and cattle, to the end that, living
independently, they might provide his people with gratuitous
amusement.&nbsp; But at the end of one year they were found to
have neglected agricultural operations, to have wasted their seed
corn, and to be thus destitute of all means of subsistence.&nbsp;
Then Behr&acirc;m G&ucirc;r, being angry, commanded them to take
their asses and instruments, and roam through the country,
earning a livelihood by their songs.&nbsp; The poet concludes as
follows:&mdash;&lsquo;The L&uuml;ry, agreeably to this mandate,
now wander about the world in search of employment, <!-- page
30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>associating with dogs and wolves, and thieving on the
road, by day and by night.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; These words were
penned nearly nine centuries ago, and correctly describe the
condition of one of the wandering tribes of Persia at the present
day, and they have been identified by some travellers as members
of the Gipsy family.</p>
<p>Dr. Von Bott goes on to say this:&mdash;&ldquo;The tradition
of the importation of the L&uuml;ry from India is related by no
less than five Persian or Arab writers: first, about the year 940
by Hamza, an Arab historian, born at Ispahan; next, as we have
seen, by Firdusi; in the year 1126 by the author of the
&lsquo;Modjmel-al-Yevaryk;&rsquo; in the fifteenth century by
Mirkhoud, the historian of the Sassanides.&nbsp; The transplanted
musicians are called by Hamza <i>Zuth</i>, and in some
manuscripts of Mirkhoud&rsquo;s history the same name occurs,
written, according to the Indian orthography, <i>Djatt</i>.&nbsp;
These words are undistinguishable when pronounced, and, in fact,
may be looked upon as phonetically equivalent, the Arabic
<i>z</i> being the legitimate representative of the Indian
<i>dj</i>.&nbsp; Now Zuth or Zatt, as it is indifferently
written, is one of the designations of the Syrian Gipsies, and
Djatt is the tribal appellative of the ancient Indian race still
widely diffused throughout the Punjab and Beloochistan.&nbsp;
Thus we find that the modern L&uuml;ry, who may, without fear of
error, be classed as Persian Gipsies, derive a traditional origin
from certain Indian minstrels called by an Arab author of the
tenth century <i>Zuth</i>, and by a Persian historian of the
fifteenth, <i>Djatt</i>, a name claimed, on the one hand by the
Gipsies frequenting the neighbourhood of Damascus, and on the
other by a people dwelling in the valley of the
Indus.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Djatts were averse to religious
speculation, and rejected all sectarian observances; the Hindu
was mystical and meditative, and a slave to the superstitions of
caste.&nbsp; From a remote period there were Djatt settlements
along the shores of the Persian Gulf, plainly indicating the
route by which the Gipsies travelled westward from India, as I
have before <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>intimated, rather than endure the
life of an Indian slave under the Mohammedan task-masters.&nbsp;
Liberty! liberty! free and wild as partridges, with no
disposition to earn their bread by the sweat of the brow, ran
through their nature like an electric wire, which the chirp of a
hedge-sparrow in spring-time would bring into action, and cause
them to bound like wild asses to the lanes, commons, and
moors.&nbsp; They have always refused to submit to the Mohammedan
faith: in fact, the Djatts have accepted neither Brahma nor
Budda, and have never adopted any national religion
whatever.&nbsp; The church of the Gipsies, according to a popular
saying in Hungary, &ldquo;was built of bacon, and long ago eaten
by the dogs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Captain Richard F. Burton wrote in
1849, in his work called the &ldquo;Sindh, and the Races that
Inhabit the Valley of the Indus:&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It seems
probable, from the appearance and other peculiarities of the
race, that the Djatts are connected by consanguinity with that
singular race, the Gipsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some writers have
endeavoured to prove that the Gipsies were formerly Egyptians;
but, from several causes, they have never been able to show
conclusively that such was the case.&nbsp; The wandering Gipsies
in Egypt, at the present day, are not looked upon by the
Egyptians as in any way related to them.&nbsp; Then, again,
others have tried to prove that the Gipsies are the descendants
of Hagar; but this argument falls to the ground simply because
the connecting links have not been found.&nbsp; The two main
reasons alleged by Mr. Groom and those who try to establish this
theory are, first, that the Ishmaelites are wanderers; second,
that they are smiths, or workers in iron and brass.&nbsp; The
Mohammedans claim Ishmael as their father, and certainly they
would be in a better position to judge upon this point eleven
centuries ago then we possibly can be at this late date.&nbsp;
And so, in like manner, where it is alleged that the Gipsies
sprang from, Roumania, Wallachia, Moldavia, Spain, and
Hungary.</p>
<p>The following are specimens of Indian characters, taken <!--
page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>from &ldquo;The People of India,&rdquo; prepared under
the authority of the Indian Government, and edited by Dr. Forbes
Watson, M.A., and Sir John William Kaye, F.R.S.&nbsp; In speaking
of the Changars, they say that these Indians have an unenviable
character for thieving and general dishonesty, and form one of
the large class of unsettled wanderers which, inadmissible to
Hinduism and unconverted to the Mohammedan faith, lives on in a
miserable condition of life as outcasts from the more civilised
communities.&nbsp; Changars are, in general, petty thieves and
pickpockets, and have no settled vocation.&nbsp; They object to
continuous labour.&nbsp; The women make baskets, beg, pilfer, or
sift and grind corn.&nbsp; They have no settled places of
residence, and live in small blanket or mat tents, or temporary
sheds outside villages.&nbsp; They are professedly Hindus and
worshippers of Deree or Bhowanee, but they make offerings at
Mohammedan shrines.&nbsp; They have private ceremonies, separate
from those of any professed faith, which are connected with the
aboriginal belief that still lingers among the descendants of the
most ancient tribes of India, and is chiefly a propitiation of
malignant demons and malicious sprites.&nbsp; They marry
exclusively among themselves, and polygamy is common.&nbsp; In
appearance, both men and women are repulsively mean and wretched;
the features of the women in particular being very ugly, and of a
strong aboriginal type.&nbsp; The Changars are one of the most
miserable and useless of the wandering tribes of the upper
provinces.&nbsp; They feed, as it were, on the garbage left by
others, never changing, never improving, never advancing in the
social rank, scale, or utility&mdash;outcast and foul parasites
from the earliest ages, and they so remain.&nbsp; The Changars,
like other vagrants, are of dissolute habits, indulging freely in
intoxicating liquors, and smoking ganjia, or cured hemp leaves,
to a great extent.&nbsp; Their food can hardly be particularised,
and is usually of the meanest description; occasionally, however,
there are assemblies of the caste, when sheep are killed and
eaten; and at marriages <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>and other domestic occurrences feasts
are provided, which usually end in foul orgies.&nbsp; In the
clothes and person the Changars are decidedly unclean, and
indeed, in most respects the repulsiveness of the tribes can
hardly be exceeded.</p>
<p>The Doms are a race of Gipsies found from Central India to the
far Northern frontier, where a portion of their early ancestry
appear as the Domarr, and are supposed to be pre-Aryan.&nbsp; In
&ldquo;The People of India,&rdquo; we are told that the
appearance and modes of life of the Doms indicate a marked
difference from those who surround them (in Behar).&nbsp; The
Hindus admit their claim to antiquity.&nbsp; Their designation in
the Shastras is Sopuckh, meaning dog-eater.&nbsp; They are
wanderers, they make baskets and mats, and are inveterate
drinkers of spirits, spending all their earnings on it.&nbsp;
They have almost a monopoly as to burning corpses and handling
all dead bodies.&nbsp; They eat all animals which have died a
natural death, and are particularly fond of pork of this
description.&nbsp; &ldquo;Notwithstanding profligate habits, many
of them attain the age of eighty or ninety; and it is not till
sixty or sixty-five that their hair begins to get
white.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Domarr are a mountain race, nomads,
shepherds, and robbers.&nbsp; Travellers speak of them as
&ldquo;Gipsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; A specimen which we have of their
language would, with the exception of one word, which is probably
an error of the transcriber, be intelligible to any English
Gipsy, and be called pure Romany.&nbsp; Finally, the ordinary Dom
calls himself a Dom, his wife a Domni, and the being a Dom, or
the collective Gipsydom, Domnipana.&nbsp; <i>D</i> in Hindustani
is found as <i>r</i> in English Gipsy speech&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
<i>doi</i>, a wooden spoon, is known in Europe as
<i>roi</i>.&nbsp; Now in common Romany we have, even in
London:&mdash;</p>

<p><!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>Of this word <i>rom</i> we shall more to say.&nbsp; It
may be observed that there are in the Indian <i>Dom</i> certain
distinctly-marked and degrading features, characteristic of the
European Gipsy, which are out of keeping with the habits of
warriors, and of a daring Aryan race which withstood the
caliphs.&nbsp; Grubbing in filth as if by instinct, handling
corpses, making baskets, eating carrion, living for drunkenness,
does not agree with anything we can learn of the Jats.&nbsp; Yet
the European Gipsies are all this, and at the same time
&lsquo;horsey&rsquo; like the Jats.&nbsp; Is it not extremely
probable that during the &ldquo;out-wandering&rdquo; the Dom
communicated his name and habits to his fellow-emigrants?</p>
<p>The marked musical talent characteristic of the Slavonian and
other European Gipsies appears to link them with the L&uuml;ri of
Persia.&nbsp; These are distinctly Gipsies; that is to say, they
are wanderers, thieves, fortune-tellers, and minstrels.&nbsp; The
Shah-Nameh of Firdusi tells us that about the year 420 <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span>, Shankal, the Maharajah of India, sent
to Behram Gour, a ruler of the Sassanian dynasty in Persia, ten
thousand minstrels, male and female, called
<i>L&uuml;ri</i>.&nbsp; Though lands were allotted to them, with
corn and cattle, they became from the beginning irreclaimable
vagabonds.&nbsp; Of their descendants, as they now exist, Sir
Henry Pottinger says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They bear a marked affinity to the Gipsies of
Europe.&rdquo;&nbsp; [&ldquo;Travels in Beloochistan and
Scinde,&rdquo; p. 153.]&nbsp; &ldquo;They speak a dialect
peculiar to themselves, have a king to each troupe, and are
notorious for kidnapping and pilfering.&nbsp; Their principal
pastimes are drinking, dancing, and music. . . . They are
invariably attended by half a dozen of bears and monkeys that are
broken in to perform all manner of grotesque tricks.&nbsp; In
each company there are always two or three members who profess .
. . modes of divining which procure them a ready admission into
every society.&rdquo;&nbsp; This account, especially with the
mention of trained bears and monkeys, identifies them with the
Ricinari, or bear-leading <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>Gipsies of
Syria (also called Nuri), Turkey, and Roumania.&nbsp; A party of
these lately came to England.&nbsp; We have seen these Syrian
Ricinari in Egypt.&nbsp; They are unquestionably Gipsies, and it
is probable that many of them accompanied the early migration of
Jats and Doms.</p>
<p>The following is the description of another low-caste,
wandering tribe of Indians, taken from &ldquo;The People of
India,&rdquo; called &ldquo;Sanseeas,&rdquo; vagrants of no
particular creed, and make their head-quarters near Delhi.&nbsp;
The editor, speaking of this tribe, says that they have been
vagrants from the earliest periods of Indian history.&nbsp; They
may have accompanied Aryan immigrants or invaders, or they may
have risen out of aboriginal tribes; but whatever their origin,
they have not altered in any respect, and continue to prey upon
its population as they have ever done, and will continue to do as
long as they are in existence, unless they are forcibly
restrained by our Government and converted, as the Thugs have
been, into useful members of society.</p>
<p>They are essentially outcasts, admitted to no other caste
fellowship, ministered to by no priests, without any ostensible
calling or profession, totally ignorant of everything but their
hereditary crime, and with no settled place of residence
whatever; they wander as they please over the land, assuming any
disguise they may need, and for ever preying upon the
people.&nbsp; When they are not engaged in acts of crime, they
are beggars, assuming various religious forms, or affecting the
most abject poverty.&nbsp; The women and children have the true
whine of the professional mendicant, as they frequent thronged
bazaars, receiving charity and stealing what they can.&nbsp; They
sell mock baubles in some instances, but only as a cloak to other
enterprises, and as a pretence of an honest calling.&nbsp; The
men are clever at assuming disguises; and being often intelligent
and even polite in their demeanour, can become religious
devotees, travelling merchants, or whatever they need to further
their ends.&nbsp; They are perfectly unscrupulous and very daring
in their proceedings.&nbsp; <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>The Sanseeas
are not only Thugs and Dacoits, but kidnappers of children, and
in particular of female children, who are readily sold even at
very tender ages to be brought up as household slaves, or to be
educated by professional classes for the purpose of
prostitution.&nbsp; These crimes are the peculiar offence of the
women members of the tribe.&nbsp; Generally a few families in
company wander over the whole of Northern India, but are also
found in the Deccan, sometimes by themselves, sometimes in
association with Khimjurs, or a class of Dacoits, called
Mooltanes.&nbsp; It is, perhaps, a difficult question for
Government to deal with, but it is not impossible, as the Thugs
have been employed in useful and profitable arts, and thus
reclaimed from pursuits in which they have never known in regard
to others the same instincts of humanity which exist among
ourselves.&nbsp; Sanseeas have as many wives and concubines as
they can support.&nbsp; Some of the women are good-looking, but
with all classes, women and men, exists an appearance of
suspicion in their features which is repulsive.&nbsp; They are,
as a class, in a condition of miserable poverty, living from hand
to mouth, idle, disreputable, restless, without any settled
homes, and for the most part without even habitations.&nbsp; They
have no distinct language of their own, but speak a dialect of
Rajpootana, which is disguised by slang or <i>argot</i> terms of
their own that is unintelligible to other classes.&nbsp; In
&ldquo;The People of India&rdquo; mention is made of another
class of wandering Indians, called Nuts, or N&acirc;ths, who
correspond to the European Gipsy tribes, and like these, have no
settled home.&nbsp; They are constant thieves.&nbsp; The men are
clever as acrobats.&nbsp; The women attend their performances,
and sing or play on native drums or tambourines.&nbsp; The Nuts
do not mix with or intermarry with other tribes.&nbsp; They live
for the most part in tents made of black blanket stuff, and move
from village to village through all parts of the country.&nbsp;
They are as a marked race, and generally distrusted wherever they
go.</p>
<p><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>They are musicians, dancers, conjurers, acrobats,
fortune-tellers, blacksmiths, robbers, and dwellers in
tents.&nbsp; They eat everything, except garlic.&nbsp; There are
also in India the Banjari, who are spoken of by travellers as
&ldquo;Gipsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are travelling merchants or
pedlars.&nbsp; Among all of these wanderers there is a current
slang of the roads, as in England.&nbsp; This slang extends even
into Persia.&nbsp; Each tribe has its own, but the general name
for it is <i>Rom</i>.</p>
<p>It has never been pointed out, however, that there is in
Northern and Central India a distinct tribe, which is regarded
even by the Nats and Doms and Jats themselves, as peculiarly and
distinctly Gipsy.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have met,&rdquo; says one
writer, &ldquo;in London with a poor Mohammedan Hindu of
Calcutta.&nbsp; This man had in his youth lived with these
wanderers, and been, in fact, one of them.&nbsp; He had also, as
is common with intelligent Mohammedans, written his
autobiography, embodying in it a vocabulary of the Indian Gipsy
language.&nbsp; This MS. had unfortunately been burned by his
English wife, who informed the writer that she had done so
&lsquo;because she was tired of seeing a book lying about which
she could not understand.&rsquo;&nbsp; With the assistance of an
eminent Oriental scholar who is perfectly familiar with both
Hindustani and Romany, this man was carefully examined.&nbsp; He
declared that these were the real Gipsies of India, &lsquo;like
English Gipsies here.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;People in India called
them Trablus or Syrians, a misapplied word, derived from a town
in Syria, which in turn bears the Arabic name for Tripoli.&nbsp;
But they were, as he was certain, pure Hindus, and not Syrian
Gipsies.&nbsp; They had a peculiar language, and called both this
tongue and themselves <i>Rom</i>.&nbsp; In it bread was called
Manro.&rsquo;&nbsp; Manro is all over Europe the Gipsy word for
<i>bread</i>.&nbsp; In English Romany it is softened into
<i>maro</i> or <i>morro</i>.&nbsp; Captain Burton has since
informed us that <i>manro</i> is the Afghan word for bread; but
this our ex-Gipsy did not know.&nbsp; He merely said that he did
not know it in any Indian dialect except that of the <!-- page
38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>Rom,
and that Rom was the general slang of the road, derived, as he
supposed, from the Trablus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are, then, the very Gipsies of Gipsies in India.&nbsp;
They are thieves, fortune-tellers, and vagrants.&nbsp; But
whether they have or had any connection with the migration to the
West we cannot establish.&nbsp; Their language and their name
would seem to indicate it; but then it must be borne in mind that
the word Rom, like Dom, is one of wide dissemination, Dom being a
Syrian Gipsy word for the race.&nbsp; And the very great majority
of even English Gipsy words are Hindu, with an admixture of
Persian, and not belonging to a slang of any kind.&nbsp; As in
India, <i>churi</i> is a knife, <i>nak</i>, the nose,
<i>balia</i>, hairs, and so on, with others which would be among
the first to be furnished with slang equivalents.&nbsp; And yet
these very Gipsies are <i>Rom</i>, and the wife is a
<i>Romni</i>, and they use words which are not Hindu in common
with European Gipsies.&nbsp; It is therefore not improbable that
in these Trablus, so called through popular ignorance, as they
are called Tartars in Egypt and Germany, we have a portion at
least of the real stock.&nbsp; It is to be desired that some
resident in India would investigate the Trablus.</p>
<p>Grellmann in his German treatise on Gipsies,
says:&mdash;&ldquo;They are lively, uncommonly loquacious and
chattering, fickle in the extreme, consequently inconstant in
their pursuits, faithless to everybody, even their own kith and
kin, void of the least emotion of gratitude, frequently rewarding
benefits with the most insidious malice.&nbsp; Fear makes them
slavishly compliant when under subjection, but having nothing to
apprehend, like other timorous people, they are cruel.&nbsp;
Desire of revenge often causes them to take the most desperate
resolutions.&nbsp; To such a degree of violence is their fury
sometimes excited, that a mother has been known in the excess of
passion to take her small infant by the feet, and therewith
strike the object of her anger.&nbsp; They are so addicted to
drinking as to sacrifice what is most necessary <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>to them that
they may feast their palates with ardent spirits.&nbsp; Nothing
can exceed the unrestrained depravity of manners existing among
them.&nbsp; Unchecked by any idea of shame they give way to every
libidinous desire.&nbsp; The mother endeavours by the most
scandalous arts to train up her daughter for an offering to
sensuality, and she is scarcely grown up before she becomes the
seducer of others.&nbsp; Laziness is so prevalent among them that
were they to subsist by their own labour only, they would hardly
have bread for two of the seven days in the week.&nbsp; This
indolence increases their propensity to stealing and
cheating.&nbsp; They seek to avail themselves of every
opportunity to satisfy their lawless desires.&nbsp; Their
universal bad character, therefore, for fickleness, infidelity,
ingratitude, revenge, malice, rage, depravity, laziness, knavery,
thievishness, and cunning, though not deficient in capacity and
cleverness, renders them people of no use in society.&nbsp; The
boys will run like wild things after carrion, let it stink ever
so much, and where a mortality happens among the cattle, there
these wretched creatures are to be found in the greatest
numbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So devilish are their hearts, deep-rooted their revenge, and
violent their language under its impulse, that it is woe to the
man who comes within their clutches, if he does not possess an
amount of tact sufficient to cope with them.&nbsp; A man who
desires to tackle the Gipsies must have his hands out of his
pockets, &ldquo;all his buttons on,&rdquo; &ldquo;his head
screwed upon the right place,&rdquo; and no fool, or he will be
swamped before he leaves the place.&nbsp; This I experienced
myself a week or two since.&nbsp; During the months of November
and December of last year, my friend, the <i>Illustrated London
News</i>, had a number of faithful sketches showing Gipsy life
round London; these, it seems, with the truthful description I
have given of the Gipsies, in my letters, papers, &amp;c.,
encouraged by the untruthful, silly, and unwise remarks of a
clergyman, not overdone with too much wisdom and <!-- page
40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>common sense, residing in the neighbourhood of N---
Hill, seemed to have raised the ire of the Gipsies in the
neighbour hood of L--- Road (I will not go so far as to say that
the minister of Christ Church did it designedly, if he did, and
with the idea of stopping the work of education among the Gipsy
children&mdash;it is certain that this farthing rushlight has
mistaken his calling) to such an extent that a friend wrote to
me, stating that the next time I went to the neighbourhood of
N--- Hill I &ldquo;must look out for a warm reception,&rdquo; to
which I replied, that &ldquo;the sooner I had it the better, and
I would go for it in a day or two;&rdquo; accordingly I went,
believing in the old Book, &ldquo;Resist the devil and he will
flee from thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon my first approach towards them,
I was met with sour looks, scowls, and not over polite language,
but with a little pleasantry, chatting, and a few little things,
such as Christmas cards, oranges to give to the children, the sun
began to beam upon their countenances, and all passed off with
smiles, good humour, and shakes of the hands, till I came to a
man who had the colour and expression upon his face of his
satanic majesty from the regions below.&nbsp; It took me all my
time to smile and say kind things while he was pacing up and down
opposite his tent, with his hands clenched, his eye like fire,
step quick, reminding me of Indian revenge.&nbsp; He was speaking
out in no unmistakable language, &ldquo;I should like to see you
hung like a toad by the neck till you are dead, that I should,
and I mean it from my heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; When I asked him to
point out anything I had said or done that was not correct, he
was in a fix, and all he could say was, that &ldquo;I would be
likely to stop his game.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every now and then he would
thrust his hands into his pockets, as if feeling for his
clasp-knife, and then again, occasionally, he would give a shrug
of the shoulders, as if he felt not at all satisfied.&nbsp; I
felt in my pocket, and opened my small penknife.&nbsp; I thought
it might do a little service in case he should &ldquo;close in
upon me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Just to feel his pulse, and set his heart a
beating, I told him, good-humouredly, that <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>&ldquo;I was
not afraid of half-a-dozen better men than he was if they would
come one at a time, but did not think I could tackle them all at
once.&rdquo;&nbsp; This caused him to open his eyes wider than I
had seen them before, as if in wonder and amazement at the kind
of fellow he had come in contact with.&nbsp; I told him I was
afraid that he would find me a queer kind of customer.&nbsp;
Gipsies as a rule are cowards, and this feature I could see in
his actions and countenance.&nbsp; However, after talking matters
over for some time we parted friends, feeling thankful that the
storm had abated.</p>
<p>The Gipsies plan of attacking a house, town, city, or country
for the sake of pillage, plunder, and gain remains the same
to-day as it did eight centuries ago.&nbsp; They do not generally
resort to open violence as the brigands of Spain, Turkey and
other parts of the East.&nbsp; They follow out an organised
system, at least, they go to work upon different lines.&nbsp; In
the first place, they send a kind of advance-guard to find out
where the loot and soft hearts lay and the weaknesses of those
who hold them, and when this has been done they bring all the
arts their evil disposition can devise to bear upon the weak
points till they are successful.&nbsp; When Mahmood was returning
with his victorious army from the war in the eleventh century
with the spoils and plunder of war upon their backs, and while
the soldiers were either lain down to rest or allured away with
the Gipsy girls&rsquo; &ldquo;witching eyes,&rdquo; the old
Gipsies, numbering some hundreds, who where camping in the
neighbourhood, bolted off with their war prizes; this so enraged
Mahmood, after finding out that he had been sold by a lot of
low-caste Indians or Gipsies, that he sent his army after them
and slew the whole band of these wandering Indians.</p>

<p>Sometimes they will put on a hypocritical air of religious
sanctity; at other times they will dress their prettiest girls in
Oriental finery and gaudy colours on purpose to catch the unwary;
at other times they will try to lay hold of the <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>sympathic by
sending out their old women and tottering men dressed in rags;
and at other times they will endeavour to lay hold of the
benevolent by sending out women heavily laden with babies, and in
this way they have Gipsyised and are still Gipsyising our own
country from the time they landed in Scotland in the year 1514,
until they besieged London now more than two centuries ago,
planting their encampments in the most degraded parts on the
outskirts of our great city; and this holds good of them even to
this day.&nbsp; They are never to be seen living in the throng of
a town or in the thick of a fight.&nbsp; In sketching the plan of
campaigning for the day, the girls with pretty &ldquo;everlasting
flowers&rdquo; go in one direction, the women with babies tackle
the tradesmen and householders by selling skewers, clothes-pegs,
and other useful things, but in reality to beg, and the old women
with the assistance of the servant girls face the brass knockers
through the back kitchen.&nbsp; The men are all this time either
loitering about the tents or skulking down the lanes spotting out
their game for the night, with their lurcher dogs at their
heels.&nbsp; Thus the Gipsy lives and thus the Gipsy dies, and is
buried like a dog; his tent destroyed, and his soul flown to
another world to await the reckoning day.&nbsp; He can truthfully
say as he leaves his tenement of clay behind, &ldquo;No man
careth for my soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; Charles Wesley, no doubt, in his
day, had seen vast numbers of these wandering English heathens in
various parts of the country as he travelled about on his
missionary tour, and it is not at all improbable but that they
were in his mind when those soul-inspiring, elevating, and
tear-fetching lines were penned by him in 1748, and first
published by subscription in his &ldquo;Hymns and Sacred
Poems,&rdquo; 2 vols., 1749, the profits of which enabled him to
get a wife and set up housekeeping on his own account at
Bristol.&nbsp; They are words that have healed thousands of
broken hearts, fixed the hopes of the downcast on heaven, and
sent the sorrowful on his way rejoicing; and they are words that
will live as <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span

<p>It is impossible to give anything like a correct number of
Gipsies that are outside Europe.&nbsp; Many travellers have
attempted to form some idea of the number, and have come to the
conclusion that there were not less than 3,000 families in Persia
in 1856, and in 1871 there were not less than 67,000 Gipsies in
Armenia and Asiatic Turkey.&nbsp; In Egypt of one tribe only
there are 16,000.&nbsp; With regard to the number of Gipsies
there are in America no one has been able to compute; but by this
time the number must be considerable, for stragglers have been
wending their way there from England, Europe, and other parts of
the world for some time.</p>
<p>Mikliosch, in 1878, stated that there are not less than
700,000 in Europe.&nbsp; Turkey, previous to the war with Russia,
104,750, Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1874 contained 9,537.&nbsp;
Servia in 1874 had 24,691; in 1873 Montenegro <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>had 500, and
in Roumania there are at the present time from 200,000 to
300,000.&nbsp; According to various official estimates in Austria
there are about 10,000, and in 1846 Bohemia contained 13,500, and
Hungary 159,000.&nbsp; In Transylvania in 1850 there were 78,923,
and in Hungary proper there were in 1864, 36,842.&nbsp; In Spain
there are 40,000; in France from 3,000 to 6,000; in Germany and
Italy, 34,000; Scandinavia, 1,500; in Russia they numbered in
1834, 48,247, exclusive of Polish Gipsies.&nbsp; Ten years later
they numbered 1,427,539, and in 1877 the number is given as
11,654.&nbsp; It seems somewhat strange that the number of
Gipsies should be in 1844, 1,427,539, and thirty-five years later
the number should have been reduced to 11,654.&nbsp; Presuming
these figures to be correct, the question arises, What has become
of the 1,415,885 during the last thirty-five years?</p>
<p>As regards the number of Gipsies in England, Hoyland in his
day, 1816, calculated that there were between 15,000 and 18,000,
and goes on to say this:&mdash;&ldquo;It has come to the
knowledge of the writer what foundation there has been for the
report commonly circulated that a member of Parliament had stated
in the House of Commons, when speaking on some question relating
to Ireland, that there were not less than 36,000 Gipsies in Great
Britain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make up such an aggregate the numerous hordes must
have been included who traverse most of the nation with carts and
asses for the sale of earthenware, and live out of doors great
part of the year, after the manner of the Gipsies.&nbsp; These
potters, as they are commonly called, acknowledge that Gipsies
have intermingled with them, and their habits are very
similar.&nbsp; They take their children along with them on
travel, and, like the Gipsies, regret that they are without
education.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Hoyland says that he endeavoured to
obtain the number of pot-hawking families of this description who
visited the earthenware manufactories at Tunstall, Burslem,
Longport, Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>Fenton,
Longton, and other places in Staffordshire, but without
success.</p>
<p>Borrow, in his time, 1843, put the number as upwards of
10,000.&nbsp; The last census shows that there were under 4,000;
but then it should be borne in mind that the Gipsies decidedly
objected to their numbers being taken.&nbsp; Their reason for
taking this step and putting obstacles in the way of the
census-takers has never been stated, except that they looked upon
it with a superstitious regard and dislike, the same as they look
upon photographers, painters, and artists, as kind of
<i>Bengaw</i>, for whom Gipsy models will sit for
<i>soonakei</i>, <i>Roopeno</i>, or even a
<i>posh-hovi</i>.&nbsp; They told me that during the day the
census was taken they made it a point to always be upon the move,
and skulking about in the dark.&nbsp; The census returns for the
number of canal-boatmen gives under 12,000.&nbsp; The Duke of
Richmond stated in the House of Lords, August 8, 1877, that there
were between 29,000 and 80,000 canal boatmen.&nbsp; The number I
published in the daily papers in 1873, viz., 100,000 men, women,
and children is being verified as the Canal Boats Act is being
put into operation.</p>
<p>At a pretty good rough estimate I reckon there are at least
from 15,000 to 20,000 Gipsies in the United Kingdom.&nbsp; Apart
from London, if I may take ten of the Midland counties as a fair
average, there are close upon 3,000 Gipsy families living in
tents and vans in the by-lanes, and attending fairs, shows,
&amp;c.; and providing there are only man, wife, and four
children connected with each charmless, cheerless, wretched
abodes called domiciles, this would show us 18,000; and judging
from my own inquiries and observation, and also from the reliable
statements of others who have mixed among them, there are not
less than 2,000 on the outskirts of London in various nooks,
corners, and patches of open spaces.&nbsp; Thus it will be seen,
according to this statement, we shall have 1,000 Gipsies for
every 1,750,000 of the inhabitants in our great London; and this
proportion will be fully borne out throughout the rest of the
country; <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>so taking either the Midland counties
or London as an average, we arrive at pretty much the same
number&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, 15,000 to 20,000 in our midst, and
moving about from place to place.&nbsp; Upon Leicester Race
Course, at the last races, I counted upwards of ninety tents,
vans, and shows; connected with each there would be an average of
man, woman, and three children.&nbsp; A considerable number of
Gipsies would also be at Nottingham, for the Goose Fair was on
about the same time.&nbsp; One gentleman tells me that he has
seen as many as 5,000 Gipsies collected together at one time in
the North of England.</p>
<p>Of this 20,000, 19,500 cannot read a sentence and write a
letter.&nbsp; The highest state of their education is to make
crosses, signs, and symbols, and to ask people to tell them the
names of the streets, and read the mile-posts for them.&nbsp; The
full value of money they know perfectly well.&nbsp; Out of this
20,000 there will be 8,000 children of school age loitering about
the tents and camps, and not learning a single letter in the
alphabet.&nbsp; The others mostly will tell you that they have
&ldquo;finished their education,&rdquo; and when questioned on
the point and asked to put three letters together, you put them
into a corner, and they are as dumb as mutes.&nbsp; Of the whole
number of Gipsy children probably a few hundreds might be
attending Sunday-schools, and picking up a few crumbs of
education in this way.&nbsp; Then, again, we have some 1,500 to
2,000 families of our own countrymen travelling about the country
with their families selling hardware and other goods, from
Manchester, Sheffield, Birmingham, Leeds, Leicester, the
Staffordshire potteries, and other manufacturing towns, from
London, Liverpool, Nottingham, and other places, the children
running wild and forgetting in the summer, as a show-woman told
me, the little education they receive in the winter.</p>
<p>Caravans will be moving about in our midst with &ldquo;fat
babies,&rdquo; &ldquo;wax-work models,&rdquo; &ldquo;wonders of
the age,&rdquo; &ldquo;the greatest giant in the world,&rdquo;
&ldquo;a living skeleton,&rdquo; &ldquo;the <!-- page 47--><a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>smallest man
alive,&rdquo; &ldquo;menageries,&rdquo; &ldquo;wild beast
shows,&rdquo; &ldquo;rifle galleries,&rdquo; and like things
connected with these caravans; there will be families of
children, none of whom, or at any rate but very few of them, are
receiving an education and attending any school, and living
together regardless of either sex or age, in one small van.&nbsp;
In addition to these, we have some 3,000 or 4,000 children of
school age &ldquo;on the road&rdquo; tramping with their parents,
who sleep in common lodging-houses, and who might be brought
under educational supervision on the plan I shall suggest later
on in this book.&nbsp; Altogether, with the Gipsies, we have a
population of over 30,000 outside our educational and sanitary
laws, fast drifting into a state of savagery and barbarism, with
our hands tied behind us, and unable to render them help.</p>

</a></p>
<p>When as a lad I trudged along in the brick-yards, now more
than forty years ago, I remember most vividly that the popular
song of the <i>employ&eacute;s</i> of that day was</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;When lads and lasses in their best<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were dress&rsquo;d from top to toe,<br />
In the days we went a-gipsying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A long time ago;<br />
In the days we went a-gipsying,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A long time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every &ldquo;brick-yard lad&rdquo; and &ldquo;brick-yard
wench&rdquo; who would not join in singing these lines was always
looked upon as a &ldquo;stupid donkey,&rdquo; and the consequence
was that upon all occasions, when excitement was needed as a
whip, they were &ldquo;struck up;&rdquo; especially would it be
the case when the limbs of the little brick and clay carrier
began to totter and were &ldquo;fagging up.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the
task-master perceived the &ldquo;gang&rdquo; had begun to
&ldquo;slinker&rdquo; he would shout out at the top of his voice,
&ldquo;Now, lads and wenches, strike up with the:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the days we went a-gipsying, a
long time ago.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And as a result more work was ground out of the little English
slave.&nbsp; Those words made such an impression upon me at the
time that I used to wonder what &ldquo;gipsying&rdquo;
meant.&nbsp; Somehow or other I imagined that it was connected
with fortune-telling, thieving and stealing in one form or other,
especially as the lads used to sing it with &ldquo;gusto&rdquo;
<!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>when they had been robbing the potato field to have
&ldquo;a potato fuddle,&rdquo; while they were &ldquo;oven
tenting&rdquo; in the night time.&nbsp; Roasted potatoes and cold
turnips were always looked upon as a treat for the
&ldquo;brickies.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have often vowed and said many
times that I would, if spared, try to find out what
&ldquo;gipsying&rdquo; really was.&nbsp; It was a puzzle I was
always anxious to solve.&nbsp; Many times I have been like the
horse that shies at them as they camp in the ditch bank, half
frightened out of my wits, and felt anxious to know either more
or less of them.&nbsp; From the days when carrying clay and
loading canal-boats was my toil and &ldquo;gipsying&rdquo; my
song, scarcely a week has passed without the words</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;When lads and lasses in their best<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were dress&rsquo;d from top to toe,<br />
In the days we went a-gipsying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A long time ago,&rdquo;</p>
<p>ringing in my ears, and at times when busily engaged upon
other things, &ldquo;In the days we went a-gipsying&rdquo; would
be running through my mind.&nbsp; In meditation and solitude; by
night and by day; at the top of the hill, and down deep in the
dale; in the throng and battle of life; at the deathbed scene;
through evil report and good report these words, &ldquo;In the
days we went a-gipsying,&rdquo; were ever and anon at my
tongue&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; The other part of the song I quickly
forgot, but these words have stuck to me ever since.&nbsp; On
purpose to try to find out what fortune-telling was, when in my
teens I used to walk after working hours from Tunstall to Fenton,
a distance of six miles, to see &ldquo;old Elijah Cotton,&rdquo;
a well-known character in the Potteries, who got his living by
it, to ask him all sorts of questions.&nbsp; Sometimes he would
look at my hands, at other times he would put my hand into his,
and hold it while he was reading out of the Bible, and burning
something like brimstone-looking powder&mdash;the forefinger of
the other hand had to rest upon a particular passage or verse; at
other times he would give me some of this <!-- page 50--><a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>yellow-looking stuff in a small paper to wear against my
left breast, and some I had to burn exactly as the clock struck
twelve at night, under the strictest secrecy.&nbsp; The stories
this fortune-teller used to relate to me as to his wonderful
power over the spirits of the other world were very amusing, aye,
and over &ldquo;the men and women of this
generation.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was frequently telling me that he had
&ldquo;fetched men from Manchester in the dead of the night
flying through the air in the course of an hour;&rdquo; and this
kind of rubbish he used to relate to those who paid him their
shillings and half-crowns to have their fortunes told.&nbsp; My
visits lasted for a little time till he told me that he could do
nothing more, as I was &ldquo;not one of his sort.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Like Thomas called Didymus, &ldquo;hard of belief.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Except an occasional glance at the Gipsies as I have passed them
on the road-side, the subject has been allowed to rest until the
commencement of last year, when I mentioned the matter to my
friends, who, in reply, said I should find it a difficult task;
this had the effect of causing a little hesitation to come over
my sensibilities, and in this way, between hesitation and doubt,
matters went on till one day in July last year, when the voice of
Providence and the wretched condition of the Gipsy children
seemed to speak to me in language that I thought it would be
perilous to disregard.&nbsp; On my return home one evening I
found a lot of Gipsies in the streets; it struck me very forcibly
that the time for action had now arrived, and with this view in
mind I asked Moses Holland&mdash;for that was his name, and he
was the leader of the gang&mdash;to call into my house for some
knives which required grinding, and while his mate was grinding
the knives, for which I had to pay two shillings, I was getting
all the information I could out of him about the Gipsy
children&mdash;this with some additional information given to me
by Mr. Clayton and several other Gipsies at Ashby-de-la-Zouch,
together with a Gipsy woman&rsquo;s tale to my wife, mentioned in
my &ldquo;Cry of the Children from the Brick-yards <!-- page
51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>of
England,&rdquo; brought forth my first letter upon the condition
of the poor Gipsy children as it appeared in the <i>Standard</i>,
<i>Daily Chronicle</i>, and nearly every other daily paper on
August 14th of last year:&mdash;&ldquo;Some years since my
attention was drawn to the condition of these poor neglected
children, of whom there are many families eking out an existence
in the Leicestershire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire lanes.&nbsp;
Two years since a pitiful appeal was made in one of our local
papers asking me to take up the cause of the poor Gipsy children;
but I have deferred doing so till now, hoping that some one with
time and money at his disposal would come to the rescue.&nbsp;
Sir, a few weeks since our legislators took proper steps to
prevent the maiming of the little show children, who are put
through excruciating practices to please a British public, and
they would have done well at the same time if they had taken
steps to prevent the warping influence of a vagrant&rsquo;s life
having its full force upon the tribes of little Gipsy children,
dwelling in calico tents, within the sound of church
bells&mdash;if living under the body of an old cart, protected by
patched coverlets, can be called living in tents&mdash;on the
roadside in the midst of grass, sticks, stones, and mud; and they
would have done well also if they had put out their hand to
rescue from idleness, ignorance, and heathenism our roadside
arabs, <i>i.e.</i>, the children living in vans, and who attend
fairs, wakes, &amp;c.&nbsp; Recently I came across some of these
wandering tribes, and the following facts gleaned from them will
show that missionaries and schoolmasters have not done much for
them.&nbsp; Moses Holland, who has been a Gipsy nearly all his
life, says he knows about two hundred and fifty families of
Gipsies in ten of the Midland counties and thinks that a similar
proportion will be found in the rest of the United Kingdom.&nbsp;
He has seen as many as ten tents of Gipsies within a distance of
five miles.&nbsp; He thinks there will be an average of five
children in each tent.&nbsp; He has seen as many as ten or twelve
children in some tents, and not many of <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>them able to
read or write.&nbsp; His child of six months old&mdash;with his
wife ill at the same time in the tent&mdash;sickened, died, and
was &lsquo;laid out&rsquo; by him, and it was also buried out of
one of those wretched abodes on the roadside at Barrow-upon-Soar,
last January.&nbsp; When the poor thing died he had not sixpence
in his pocket.&nbsp; In shaking hands with him as we parted his
face beamed with gladness, and he said that I was the first who
had held out the hand to him during the last twenty years.&nbsp;
At another time later on I came across Bazena Clayton, who said
that she had had sixteen children, fifteen of whom are alive,
several of them being born in a roadside tent.&nbsp; She says
that she was married out of one of these tents; and her brother
died and was buried out of a tent at Packington, near
Ashby-de-la-Zouch.&nbsp; This poor woman knows about three
hundred families of Gipsies in eleven of the Midland and Eastern
counties, and has herself, so she says, four lots of Gipsies
travelling in Lincolnshire at the present time.&nbsp; She said
she could not read herself, and thinks that not one Gipsy in
twenty can.&nbsp; She has travelled all her life.&nbsp; Her
mother, named Smith, of whom there are not a few, is the mother
of fifteen children, all of whom were born in a tent.&nbsp; A
Gipsy lives, but one can scarcely tell how; they generally locate
for a time near hen-roosts, potato-camps, turnip-fields, and
game-preserves.&nbsp; They sell a few clothes-lines and
clothes-pegs, but they seldom use such things themselves.&nbsp;
Washing would destroy their beauty.&nbsp; Telling fortunes to
servant girls and old maids is a source of income to some of
them.&nbsp; They sleep, but in many instances lie crouched
together, like so many dogs, regardless of either sex or
age.&nbsp; They have blood, bone, muscle, and brains, which are
applied in many instances to wrong purposes.&nbsp; To have
between three and four thousand men and women, and fifteen
thousand children classed in the census as vagrants and
vagabonds, roaming all over the country, in ignorance and evil
training, that carries peril with it, is not a pleasant look-out
for the future; and I <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>claim on the grounds of justice and
equity, that if these poor children, living in vans and tents and
under old carts, are to be allowed to live in these places, they
shall be registered in a manner analogous to the Canal Boats Act
of 1877, so that the children may be brought under the Compulsory
Clauses of the Education Acts, and become Christianised and
civilised as other children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foregoing letter, as it appeared in the <i>Standard</i>,
brought forth the following leading article upon the subject the
following day, August 15th, in which the writer
says:&mdash;&ldquo;We yesterday published a letter from Mr.
George Smith, whose efforts to ameliorate and humanise the
floating and transitory population of our canals and navigable
rivers have already borne good fruit, in which he calls attention
to the deserted and almost hopeless lot of English Gipsy
children.&nbsp; Moses Holland&mdash;the Hollands are a Gipsy
family almost as old as the Lees or the Stanleys, and a Holland
always holds high rank among the &lsquo;Romany&rsquo;
folk&mdash;assures Mr. Smith that in ten of the Midland counties
he knows some two hundred and fifty families of Gipsies, and that
none of their children can read or write.&nbsp; Bazena Clayton,
an old lady of caste, almost equal to that of a Lee or a Holland,
confirms the story.&nbsp; She has lived in tents all her
life.&nbsp; She was born in a tent, married from a tent, has
brought up a family of sixteen children, more or less, under the
same friendly shelter, and expects to breathe her last in a
tent.&nbsp; That she can neither read nor write goes without
saying; although doubtless she knows well enough how to
&lsquo;kair her patteran,&rsquo; or to make that strange cross in
the dust which a true Gipsy alway leaves behind him at his last
place of sojourn, as a mark for those of his tribe who may come
upon his track.&nbsp; &lsquo;Patteran,&rsquo; it may be remarked,
is an almost pure Sanscrit word cognate with our own
&lsquo;path;&rsquo; and the least philological raking among the
chaff of the Gipsy dialect will show their secret <i>argot</i> to
be, as Mr. Leland calls it, &lsquo;a curious old tongue, not
merely allied to Sanscrit, but perhaps in <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>point of age
an elder though vagabond sister or cousin of that ancient
language.&rsquo;&nbsp; No Sanscrit or even Greek scholar can fail
to be struck by the fact that, in the Gipsy tongue, a road is a
&lsquo;drum,&rsquo; to see is to &lsquo;dicker,&rsquo; to get or
take to &lsquo;lell,&rsquo; and to go to &lsquo;jall;&rsquo; or,
after instances so pregnant, to agree with Professor von
Kogalnitschan that &lsquo;it is interesting to be able to study a
Hindu dialect in the heart of Europe.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Smith,
however, being a philanthropist rather than a philologist, takes
another view of the question.&nbsp; His anxiety is to see the
Gipsies&mdash;and especially the Gipsy
children&mdash;reclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;A Gipsy,&rsquo; he reminds
us, &lsquo;lives, but one can scarcely tell how; they generally
locate for a time near hen-roosts, potato-camps, turnip-fields,
and game-preserves.&nbsp; They sell a few clothes-lines and
clothes-pegs; but they seldom use such things themselves.&nbsp;
Washing would destroy their beauty . . . To have between three
and four thousand men and women, and eight or ten thousand
children, classed in the census as vagrants and vagabonds,
roaming all over the country in ignorance and evil training, is
not a pleasant look-out for the future; and I claim that if these
poor children, living in vans and tents and under old carts, are
to be allowed to live in these places, they shall be registered
in a manner analogous to the Canal Boats Act, so that the
children may be brought under the Education Acts, and become
Christianised and civilised.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Smith, it is to be feared, hardly appreciates the
insuperable difficulty of the task he proposes.&nbsp; The true
Gipsy is absolutely irreclaimable.&nbsp; He was a wanderer and a
vagabond upon the face of the earth before the foundations of
Mycen&aelig; were laid or the plough drawn to mark out the walls
of Rome; and such as he was four thousand years ago or more, such
he still remains, speaking the same tongue, leading the same
life, cherishing the same habits, entertaining the same wholesome
or unwholesome hatred of all civilisation, and now, as then,
utterly devoid of even the simplest rudiments of religious
belief.&nbsp; His whole attitude of mind is <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>negative.&nbsp; To him all who are not Gipsies, like
himself, are &lsquo;Gorgios,&rsquo; and to the true Gipsy a
&lsquo;Gorgio&rsquo; is as hateful as is a &lsquo;cowan&rsquo; to
a Freemason.&nbsp; It would be interesting to speculate whether,
when the Romany folk first began their wanderings, the
&lsquo;Gorgios&rsquo; were not&mdash;as the name would seem to
indicate&mdash;the farmers or permanent population of the earth;
and whether the nomad Gipsy may not still hate the
&lsquo;Gorgio&rsquo; as much as Cain hated Abel, Ishmael Isaac,
and Esau Jacob.&nbsp; Certain in any case it is that the Gipsy,
however civilised he may appear, remains, as Mr. Leland describes
him, &lsquo;a character so entirely strange, so utterly at
variance with our ordinary conceptions of humanity, that it is no
exaggeration whatever to declare that it would be a very
difficult task for the best writer to convey to the most
intelligent reader any idea of such a nature.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
true Gipsy is, to begin with, as devoid of superstition as of
religion.&nbsp; He has no belief in another world, no fear of a
future state, nor hope for it, no supernatural object of either
worship or dread&mdash;nothing beyond a few old stories, some
Pagan, some Christian, which he has picked up from time to time,
and to which he holds&mdash;much as a child holds to its fairy
tales&mdash;uncritically and indifferently.&nbsp; Ethical
distinctions are as unknown to him as to a kitten or a
magpie.&nbsp; He is kindly by nature, and always anxious to
please those who treat him well, and to win their
affection.&nbsp; But the distinction between affection and esteem
is one which he cannot fathom; and the precise shade of
<i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i> is as absolutely unintelligible to
him as was the Hegelian antithesis between <i>nichts</i> and
<i>seyn</i> to the late Mr. John Stuart Mill.&nbsp; To make the
true Gipsy we have only to add to this an absolute contempt for
all that constitutes civilisation.&nbsp; The Gipsy feels a house,
or indeed anything at all approaching to the idea of a permanent
dwelling, to amount to a positive restraint upon his
liberty.&nbsp; He can live on hedgehog and acorns&mdash;though he
may prefer a fowl and potatoes not strictly his own.&nbsp;
Wherever a hedge gives shelter he will roll himself <!-- page
56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>up
and sleep.&nbsp; And it is possibly because he has no property of
his own that he is so slow to recognise the rights of property in
others.&nbsp; But above all, his tongue&mdash;the weird, corrupt,
barbarous Sanscrit &lsquo;patter&rsquo; or &lsquo;jib,&rsquo;
known only to himself and to those of his blood&mdash;is the
keynote of his strange life.&nbsp; In spite of every effort that
has been made to fathom it, the Gipsy dialect is still
unintelligible to &lsquo;Gorgios&rsquo;&mdash;a few experts such
as Mr. Borrow alone excepted.&nbsp; But wherever the true Gipsy
goes he carries his tongue with him, and a Romany from Hungary,
ignorant of English as a Chippeway or an Esquimaux, will
&lsquo;patter&rsquo; fluently with a Lee, a Stanley, a Locke, or
a Holland, from the English Midlands, and make his
&lsquo;rukkerben&rsquo; at once easily understood.&nbsp; Nor is
this all, for there are certain strange old Gipsy customs which
still constitute a freemasonry.&nbsp; The marriage rites of
Gipsies are a definite and very significant ritual.&nbsp; Their
funeral ceremonies are equally remarkable.&nbsp; Not being
allowed to burn their dead, they still burn the dead man&rsquo;s
clothes and all his small property, while they mourn for him by
abstaining&mdash;often for years&mdash;from something of which he
was fond, and by taking the strictest care never to even mention
his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we to do with children in whom these strange
habits and beliefs, or rather wants of belief, are as much part
of their nature as is their physical organisation?&nbsp; Darwin
has told us how, after generations had passed, the puppy with a
taint of the wolf&rsquo;s blood in it would never come straight
to its master&rsquo;s feet, but always approach him in a
semicircle.&nbsp; Not Kuhleborhn nor Undine herself is less
susceptible of alien culture than the pure-blooded Gipsy.&nbsp;
We can domesticate the goose, we can tame the goldfinch and the
linnet; but we shall never reclaim the guinea-fowl, or accustom
the swallow to a cage.&nbsp; Teach the Gipsy to read, or even to
write; he remains a Gipsy still.&nbsp; His love of wandering is
as keen as is the instinct of a migratory bird for its annual
passage; and exactly as the prisoned cuckoo <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>of the first
year will beat itself to death against its bars when September
draws near, so the Gipsy, even when most prosperous, will never
so far forsake the traditions of his tribe as to stay long in any
one place.&nbsp; His mind is not as ours.&nbsp; A little of our
civilisation we can teach him, and he will learn it, as he may
learn to repeat by rote the signs of the zodiac or the
multiplication table, or to use a table napkin, or to decorously
dispose of the stones in a cherry tart.&nbsp; But the lesson sits
lightly on him, and he remains in heart as irreclaimable as
ever.&nbsp; Already, indeed, our Gipsies are leaving us.&nbsp;
They are not dying out, it is true.&nbsp; They are making their
way to the Far West, where land is not yet enclosed, where game
is not property, where life is free, and where there is always
and everywhere room to &lsquo;hatch the tan&rsquo; or put up the
tent.&nbsp; Romany will, in all human probability, be spoken on
the other side of the Atlantic years after the last traces of it
have vanished from amongst ourselves.&nbsp; We begin even now to
miss the picturesque aspects of Gipsy life&mdash;the tent, the
strange dress, the nomadic habits.&nbsp; English Gipsies are no
longer pure and simple vagrants.&nbsp; They are tinkers, or
scissor-grinders, or basket-makers, or travel from fair to fair
with knock-&rsquo;em-downs, or rifle galleries, or itinerant
shows.&nbsp; Often they have some ostensible place of
residence.&nbsp; But they preserve their inner life as carefully
as the Jews in Spain, under the searching persecution of the
Inquisition, preserved their faith for generation upon
generation; and even now it is a belief that when, for the sake
of some small kindness or gratuity, a Gipsy woman has allowed her
child to be baptised, she summons her friends, and attempts to
undo the effect of the ceremony by subjecting the infant to some
weird, horrible incantation of Eastern origin, the original
import of which is in all probability a profound mystery to
her.&nbsp; There is a quaint story of a Yorkshire Gipsy, a
prosperous horse-dealer, who, becoming wealthy, came up to town,
and, amongst other sights, was shown a goldsmith&rsquo;s
window.&nbsp; His sole <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>remark was that the man must be a big
thief indeed to have so many spoons and watches all at
once.&nbsp; The expression of opinion was as na&iuml;ve and
artless as that of Blucher, when observing that London was a
magnificent city &lsquo;for to sack.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Smith&rsquo;s benevolent intentions speak for themselves.&nbsp;
But if he hopes to make the Gipsy ever other than a Gipsy, to
transform the Romany into a Gorgio, of to alter habits of life
and mind which have remained unchanged for centuries, he must be
singularly sanguine, and must be somewhat too disposed to
overlook the marvellously persistent influences of race and
tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rather than the cause of the children should suffer by
presenting garbled or one-sided statements, I purpose quoting the
letters and articles upon the subject as they have
appeared.&nbsp; To do otherwise would not be fair to the authors
or just to the cause I have in hand.&nbsp; The flattering
allusions and compliments relating to my humble self I am not
worthy of, and I beg of those who take an interest in the cause
of the little ones, and deem this book worthy of their notice, to
pass over them as though such compliments were not there.&nbsp;
The following are some of the letters that have appeared in the
<i>Standard</i> in reply to mine of the 14th instant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;B. B.&rdquo; writes on August 16th:&mdash;&ldquo;Would you
allow an Irish Gipsy to express his views touching George
Smith&rsquo;s letter of this date in your paper?&nbsp; Without in
the least desiring to warp his efforts to improve any of his
fellow-creatures, it seems to me that the poor Gipsy calls for
much less sympathy, as regards his moral and social life, than
more favoured classes of the community.&nbsp; Living under the
body of an old cart, &lsquo;within the sound of church
bells,&rsquo; in the midst of grass, sticks, and stones, by no
means argues moral degradation; and if your correspondent looks
up our criminal statistics he will not find one Gipsy registered
for every five hundred criminals who have not only been within
hearing of the church bells but also listening to the
preacher&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; It should be remembered <!-- page
59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>that
the poor Gipsy fulfils a work which is a very great convenience
to dwellers in out-of-the-way places&mdash;brushes, baskets,
tubs, clothes-stops, and a host of small commodities, in
themselves apparently insignificant, but which enable this tribe
to eke out a living which compares very favourably with the
hundreds of thousands in our large cities who set the laws of the
land as well as the laws of decency at defiance.&nbsp; As to
education&mdash;well, let them get it, if possible; but it will
be found they possess, as a rule, sufficient intelligence to
discharge the duties of farm-labourers; and already they are
beginning to supply a felt want to the agriculturist whose
educated assistant leaves him to go abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An Old Woman&rdquo; writes as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;In
the article on Gipsies in the <i>Standard</i> of to-day I was
struck with the truth of this; remark&mdash;&lsquo;He is kindly
by nature, and always anxious to please those who treat him well,
and to win their affections.&rsquo;&nbsp; I can give you one
instance of this in my own family, although it happened long,
long ago.&nbsp; The Boswell tribe of Gipsies used to encamp once
a year near the village in which my grandfather (my
mother&rsquo;s father), who was a miller and farmer, lived; and
there grew up a very kindly feeling between the head of the tribe
and my grandfather and his family.&nbsp; Some of the Gipsies
would often call at my grandfather&rsquo;s house, where they were
always received kindly, and oftener still, on business or
otherwise, at the mill, to see &lsquo;Pe-tee,&rsquo; as they
called my grandfather, whose Christian name was Peter.&nbsp; Once
upon a time my grandfather owed a considerable sum of money, and,
alas! could not pay it; and his wife and children were much
distressed.&nbsp; I believe they feared he would be
arrested.&nbsp; Everything is known in a village; and the news of
what was feared reached the Gipsies.&nbsp; The idea of their
friend Pe-tee being in such trouble was not borne quietly; the
chief and one or two more appeared at the farm-house, asking to
see my grandmother.&nbsp; They told her they had come to pay my
<!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>grandfather&rsquo;s debt; &lsquo;he should never be
distressed for the money,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;as long as
they had any.&rsquo;&nbsp; I believe some arrangement had been
made about the debt, but nevertheless my grandmother felt just as
grateful for the kindness.&nbsp; The head of the tribe wore
guineas instead of buttons to his coat, and when his daughter was
married her dowry was measured in guineas, in a pint
measure.&nbsp; I suppose, as in the old ballad of &lsquo;The
Beggar of Bethnal Green,&rsquo; the suitor would give measure for
measure.&nbsp; The villagers all turned out to gaze each year
when they heard the &lsquo;Boswell gang&rsquo; were coming down
the one long street; the women of the tribe, fine, bold,
handsome-looking women, in &lsquo;black beaver bonnets, with
black feathers and red cloaks,&rsquo; sometimes quarrelled, and
my mother, then a girl, saw the procession several times stop in
the middle of the village, and two women (sometimes more) would
fall out of the ranks, hand their bonnets to friends, strip off
cloak and gown, and fight in their &lsquo;shift&rsquo; sleeves,
using their fists like men.&nbsp; The men of the tribe took no
notice, stood quietly about till the fight was over, and then the
whole bevy passed on to their camping-ground.&nbsp; My
grandfather never passed the tents without calling in to see his
friends, and it would have been an offence indeed if he had not
partaken of some refreshment.&nbsp; Two or three times my mother
accompanied him, and whenever and wherever they met her they were
always very kind and respectful to &lsquo;Pe-tee&rsquo;s little
girl.&rsquo;&nbsp; In after years, when visiting her native
village, she often inquired if it was known what had become of
the tribe; at last she heard from some one it was thought they
had settled in Canada: at any rate they had passed away for ever
from that part of England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Leland wrote as follows in the <i>Standard</i>, August
19:&mdash;&ldquo;As you have kindly cited my work on the English
Gipsies in your article on them, and as many of your readers are
giving their opinions on this curious race, perhaps you will
permit me to make a few remarks on the subject.&nbsp; <!-- page
61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Mr.
Smith is one of those honest philanthropists whom it is the duty
of every one to honour, and I for one, honour him most sincerely
for his kind wishes to the Romany; but, with all my respect, I do
not think he understands the travellers, or that they require
much aid from the &lsquo;Gorgios,&rsquo; being quite capable of
looking out for themselves.&nbsp; A <i>tacho Rom</i>, or real
Gipsy, who cannot in an emergency find his ten, or even twenty,
pounds is a very exceptional character.&nbsp; As I have, even
within a few days, been in company, and on very familiar footing
with a great number of Romanys of different families of the dark
blood who spoke the &lsquo;jib&rsquo; with unusual accuracy, I
write under a fresh impression.&nbsp; The Gipsy is almost
invariably strong and active, a good rough rider and pedestrian,
and knowing how to use his fists.&nbsp; He leads a very hard
life, and is proud of his stamina and his pluck.&nbsp; Of late
years he <i>kairs</i>, or &lsquo;houses,&rsquo; more than of old,
particularly during the winter, but his life at best requires
great strength and endurance, and this must, of course, be
supported by a generous diet.&nbsp; In fact, he lives well, much
better than the agricultural labourer.&nbsp; Let me explain how
this is generally done.&nbsp; The Gipsy year may be said to begin
with the races.&nbsp; Thither the dark children of Chun-Gwin,
whether pure blood, <i>posh an&rsquo; posh</i> (half-and-half),
or <i>churedis</i>, with hardly a drop of the <i>kalo-ratt</i>,
flock with their cocoa-nuts and the balls, which have of late
taken the place of the <i>koshter</i>, or sticks.&nbsp; With them
go the sorceresses, old and young, who pick up money by
occasional <i>dukkerin</i>, or fortune-telling.&nbsp; Other small
callings they also have, not by any means generally
dishonest.&nbsp; Wherever there is an open pic-nic on the Thames,
or a country fair, or a regatta at this season, there are
Romanys.&nbsp; Sometimes they appear looking like petty farmers,
with a bad, or even a good, horse or two for sale.&nbsp; While
summer lasts this is the life of the poorer sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This merry time over, they go to the <i>Livinengro
tem</i>, or hop-land&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Kent.&nbsp; Here they
work hard, not neglecting <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>the beer-pot,
which goes about gaily.&nbsp; In this life they have great
advantages over the tramps and London poor.&nbsp; Hopping over,
they go, almost <i>en masse</i>, or within a few days, to London
to buy French and German baskets, which they get in
Houndsditch.&nbsp; Of late years they send more for the baskets
to be delivered at certain stations.&nbsp; Some of them make
baskets themselves very well, but, as a rule, they prefer to buy
them.&nbsp; While the weather is good they live by selling
baskets, brooms, clothes-lines, and other small wares.&nbsp; Most
families have their regular &lsquo;beats&rsquo; or rounds, and
confine themselves to certain districts.&nbsp; In winter the men
begin to <i>chiv the kosh</i>, or cut wood&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
they make butchers&rsquo; skewers and clothes-pegs.&nbsp; Even
this is not unprofitable, as a family, what between manufacturing
and selling them, can earn from twelve to eighteen shillings a
week.&nbsp; With this and begging, and occasional jobs of honest
hard work which they pick up here and there, they contrive to
feed well, find themselves in beer, and pay, as they now often
must, for permission to camp in fields.&nbsp; Altogether they
work hard and retire early.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considering the lives they lead, Gipsies are not
dishonest.&nbsp; If a Gipsy is camped anywhere, and a hen is
missing for miles around, the theft is always at once attributed
to him.&nbsp; The result is that, being sharply looked after by
everybody, and especially by the police, they cannot act like
their ancestors.&nbsp; Their crimes are not generally of a
heinous nature.&nbsp; <i>Chiving a gry</i>, or stealing a horse,
is, I admit, looked upon by them with Yorkshire leniency, nor do
they regard stealing wood for fuel as a great sin.&nbsp; In this
matter they are subject to great temptation.&nbsp; When the
nights are cold&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Could anything be more alluring<br />
Than an old hedge?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As for Gipsy lying, it is so peculiar that it would be
hard to explain.&nbsp; The American who appreciates the phrase
&lsquo;to sit down and swap lies&rsquo; would not be taken in by
a <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>Romany <i>chal</i>, nor would an old salt who can spin
yarns.&nbsp; They enjoy hugely being lied unto, as do all Arabs
or Hindus.&nbsp; Like many naughty children, they like successful
efforts of the imagination.&nbsp; The old <i>dyes</i>, or
mothers, are &lsquo;awful beggars,&rsquo; as much by habit as
anything; but they will give as freely as they will take, and
their guest will always experience Oriental hospitality.&nbsp;
They are very fond of all gentlemen and ladies who take a real
interest in them, who understand them, and like them.&nbsp; To
such people they are even more honest than they are to one
another.&nbsp; But it must be a real <i>aficion</i>, not a merely
amateur affectation of kindness.&nbsp; Owing to their entire
ignorance of ordinary house and home life, they are like children
in many respects, though so shrewd in others.&nbsp; Among the
Welsh Gipsies, who are the most unsophisticated and the most
purely Romany, I have met with touching instances of gratitude
and honesty.&nbsp; The child-like ingenuity which some of them
manifested in contriving little gratifications for myself and for
Professor E. H. Palmer, who had been very kind to them, were as
na&iuml;ve as amiable.&nbsp; I have observed that some Gipsies of
the more rustic sort loved to listen to stories, but, like
children, they preferred those which they had heard several times
and learned to like.&nbsp; They knew where the laugh ought to
come in.&nbsp; The Gipsy is both bad and good, but neither his
faults nor his virtues are exactly what they are supposed to
be.&nbsp; He is certainly something of a scamp&mdash;and,
<i>nomen est omen</i>, there is a tribe of Scamps among
them&mdash;but he is not a bad scamp, and he is certainly a most
amusing and eccentric one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not the least use in trying to ameliorate the
condition of the Gipsy while he remains a traveller.&nbsp; He
will tell you piteous stories, but he will take care of
himself.&nbsp; As Ferdusi sings:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Say what you will and do what you
can,<br />
No washing e&rsquo;er whitens the black Zingan.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The only kindness he requires is a little charity and

All wrong doubtless; but something should be allowed to one whose
ancestors were called &lsquo;dead-meat eaters&rsquo; in the
Shastras.&nbsp; Should the reader wish to reform a Gipsy, let him
explain to the Romany that the days for roaming in England are
rapidly passing away.&nbsp; Tell him that for his
children&rsquo;s sake he had better rent a cheap cottage; that
his wife can just as well peddle with her basket from a house as
from a waggon, and that he can keep a horse and trap and go to
the races or hopping &lsquo;genteely.&rsquo;&nbsp; Point out to
him those who have done the same, and stimulate his ambition and
pride.&nbsp; As for suffering as a traveller he does not know
it.&nbsp; I once asked a Gipsy girl who was sitting as a model if
she liked the <i>drom</i> (road) best, or living in a
house.&nbsp; With sparkling eyes and clapping her hands she
exclaimed, &lsquo;oh, the road! the road!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Beerbohm writes under date August 19th:&mdash;&ldquo;In
reading yesterday&rsquo;s article on the customs and
idiosyncrasies of Gipsies I was struck by the similarity they
present to many peculiarities I have observed among the
Patagonian Indians.&nbsp; To those curious in such matters it may
be of interest to know that the custom of burning all the goods
and chattels of a deceased member of the tribe prevails among the
Patagonians as among the Gipsies; and the identity of custom is
still further carried out, inasmuch as with the former, as with
the latter, the name of the deceased is never uttered, and all
allusion to him is strictly avoided.&nbsp; So much so, that in
those cases when the deceased has borne some cognomen taken from
familiar objects, such as &lsquo;Knife,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Wool,&rsquo; &lsquo;Flint,&rsquo; &amp;c., the word is no
longer used by the tribe, some other sound being substituted
instead.&nbsp; This is one of the reasons why the Tshuelche
language is constantly fluctuating, but few of the words
expressing a proper meaning, as chronicled by Fitzroy and Darwin
(1832), being now in use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Hewett writes to the <i>Standard</i>, under date
August 19th, to say that he baptised two Gipsy children in <!--
page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>1871.&nbsp; One might ask, in the language of one of the
&ldquo;Old Book,&rdquo; &ldquo;What are these among so
many?&rdquo;&nbsp; The following letter from Mr. Harrison upon
the subject appeared on August 20th:&mdash;&ldquo;I have just
returned from the head-quarters of the Scotch
Gipsies&mdash;Yetholm (Kirk), a small village nestling at the
foot of the Cheviots in Roxburghshire.&nbsp; Here I saw the abode
of the Queen, a neat little cottage, with well-trimmed garden in
front.&nbsp; Inside all was a perfect pattern of neatness, and
the old lady herself was as clean &lsquo;as a new
pin.&rsquo;&nbsp; As I passed the cottage a carriage and pair
drove up, and the occupants, four ladies, alighted and entered
the cottage.&nbsp; I was afterwards told that they were much
pleased with their visit, and that, in remembrance of it, each of
the four promised to send a new frock to the Queen&rsquo;s
grandchild.&nbsp; The Queen&rsquo;s son (&lsquo;the
Prince,&rsquo; as he is called) I saw at St. James&rsquo;s Fair,
where he was swaggering about in a drunken state, offering to
fight any man.&nbsp; I believe he was subsequently locked
up.&nbsp; In the month of August there are few Gipsies resident
in Yetholm: they are generally on their travels selling
crockeryware (the country people call the Gipsies
&lsquo;muggers,&rsquo; from the fact that they sell mugs),
baskets made of rushes, and horn spoons, both of which they
manufacture themselves.&nbsp; I have a distinct recollection of
Will Faa, the then King of the Gipsies.&nbsp; He was 95 when I
knew him, and was lithe and strong.&nbsp; He had a keen hawk eye,
which was not dimmed at that extreme age.&nbsp; He was considered
both a good shot and a famous fisher.&nbsp; There was hardly a
trout hole in the Bowmont Water but he knew, and his company used
to be eagerly sought by the fly-fishers who came from the
South.&nbsp; My opinion of the Gipsies&mdash;and I have seen much
of them during the last forty years&mdash;is that they are a
lazy, dissolute set of men and women, preferring to beg, or
steal, or poach, to work, and that, although many efforts have
been made (more especially by the late Rev. Mr. Baird, of
Yetholm), to settle them, they are irreclaimable.&nbsp; There are
but two policemen in <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>Yetholm and Kirk Yetholm, but
sometimes the assistance of some of the townsfolk is required to
bring about order in that portion of the village in which the
Gipsies reside.&nbsp; I may say that the townsfolk do not
fraternise with the Gipsies, who are regarded with the greatest
suspicion by the former.&nbsp; Ask a townsman of Yetholm what he
thinks of the Gipsies, and he will tell you they are simply
vagabonds and impostors, who lounge about, and smoke, and drink,
and fight.&nbsp; In fact, they are the very scum of the human
race; and, what is more singular, they seem quite satisfied to
remain as they are, repudiating every attempt at
reformation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;F. G. S.&rdquo; writes:&mdash;&ldquo;One of your
correspondents suggests that the silence of the Gipsies
concerning their dead is carried so far as to consign them to
nameless graves.&nbsp; In my churchyard there is a headstone,
&lsquo;to the memory of Mistress Paul Stanley, wife of Mr. Paul
Stanley, who died November, 1797,&rsquo; the said Mistress
Stanley having been the Queen of the Stanley tribe.&nbsp; In my
childhood I remember that annually some of the members of the
tribe used to come and scatter flowers over the grave; and when
my father had restored the stone, on its falling into decay, a
deputation of the tribe thanked him for so doing.&nbsp; I have
reason to think they still visit the spot, to find, I am sorry to
say, the stone so decayed now as to be past restoration, and I
would much like to see another with the same inscription to mark
the resting-place of the head of a leading tribe of these
interesting people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To these letters I replied as under, on August
21st:&mdash;&ldquo;The numerous correspondents who have taken
upon themselves to reply to my letter that appeared in your issue
of the 14th inst., and to show up Gipsy life in some of its
brightest aspects, have, unwittingly, no doubt, thoroughly
substantiated and backed up the cause of my young
clients&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the poor Gipsy children and our
roadside arabs&mdash;so far as they have gone, as a reperusal of
the letters will show the most casual observer of our
hedge-bottom heathens of <!-- page 67--><a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>Christendom.&nbsp; At the same time, I would say the
tendency of some of the remarks of your correspondents has
special reference to the adult Gipsies, roamers and ramblers,
and, consequently, there is a fear that the attention of some of
your readers may be drawn from the cause of the poor uneducated
children, living in the midst of sticks, stones, ditches, mud,
and game, and concentrated upon the &lsquo;guinea buttons,&rsquo;
&lsquo;black-haired Susans,&rsquo; &lsquo;red cloaks,&rsquo;
&lsquo;scarlet hoods,&rsquo; the cunning craft of the old men,
the fortune-telling of the old women, the &lsquo;sparkling
eyes&rsquo; and &lsquo;clapping of hands,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;twopenny hops&rsquo; of the young women, who certainly can
take care of themselves, just as other un-Christianised and
uncivilised human beings can.&nbsp; I do not profess&mdash;at any
rate, not for the present&mdash;to take up the cause of the men
and women ditch-dwelling Gipsies in this matter; I must leave
that part of the work to fiction writers, clergymen, and
policemen, abler hands than mine.&nbsp; I may not be able, nor do
I profess, to understand the singular number of the masculine
gender of <i>dad</i>, <i>chavo</i>, <i>tikeno</i>, <i>moosh</i>,
<i>gorjo</i>, <i>raklo</i>, <i>rakli</i>, <i>pal palla</i>; the
feminine gender <i>dei</i>, <i>tikeno</i>, <i>chabi</i>,
<i>joovel</i>, <i>gairo</i>, <i>rakle</i>, <i>raklia</i>, <i>pen
penya</i>, or the plural of the masculine gender <i>dada</i>,
<i>chavi</i>, and the feminine gender <i>deia</i>, <i>chavo</i>;
but, being a matter of fact kind of man&mdash;out of the region
of romance, fantastical notions, enrapturing imagery, nicely
coloured imagination, clever lying and cleverer deception,
beautiful green fields, clear running rivulets, the singing of
the wood songster, bullfinch, and wren, in the midst of woodbine,
sweetbriar, and roses&mdash;with an eye to observe, a heart to
feel, and a hand ready to help, I am led to contemplate, aye, and
to find out if possible, the remedy, though my friends say it is
impossible&mdash;just because it is impossible it becomes
possible, as in the canal movement&mdash;for the wretched
condition of some eight to ten thousand little Gipsy children,
whose home in the winter is camping half-naked in a hut, so
called, in the midst of &lsquo;slush&rsquo; and snow, on the
borders of a picturesque <!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>ditch and
roadside, winterly delights, Sunday and week day alike.&nbsp; The
tendency of human nature is to look on the bright side of things;
and it is much more pleasant to go to the edge of a large swamp,
lie down and bask in the summer&rsquo;s sun, making
&lsquo;button-holes&rsquo; of daisies, buttercups, and the like,
and return home and extol the fine scenery and praise the
richness of the land, than to take the spade, in shirt-sleeves
and heavy boots, and drain the poisonous water from the roots of
vegetation.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it has to be done, if the
&lsquo;strong active limbs&rsquo; and &lsquo;bright sparkling
eyes&rsquo; are to be turned to better account than they have
been in the past.&nbsp; It is not creditable to us as a Christian
nation, in size compared with other nations not much larger than
a garden, to have had for centuries these heathenish tribes in
our midst.&nbsp; It does not speak very much for the power of the
Gospel, the zeal of the ministers of Christ&rsquo;s Church, and
the activity of the schoolmaster, to have had these plague spots
continually flitting before our eyes without anything being done
to effect a cure.&nbsp; It is true something has been done.&nbsp;
One clergyman, who has &lsquo;had opportunities of observing
them,&rsquo; if not brought in daily contact with them, tells us
that some eight or nine years since he publicly baptised two
Gipsy children.&nbsp; Another tells us that some time since he
baptised many Gipsy children, as if baptism was the only thing
required of the poor children for the duties and responsibilities
of life and a future state.&nbsp; Better a thousand times have
told us how many poor roadside arabs and Gipsy children they have
taken by the hand to educate and train them, so as to be able to
earn an honest livelihood, instead of &lsquo;cadging&rsquo; from
door to door, and telling all sorts of silly stories and
lies.&nbsp; How many poor children&rsquo;s lives have been
sacrificed at the hands of cruelty, starvation, and neglect, and
buried under a clod without the shedding of a tear, it is fearful
to contemplate.&nbsp; The idlers, loafers, rodneys, mongrels,
gorgios, and Gipsies are increasing, and will increase, in our
midst, unless we put our hand <!-- page 69--><a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>upon the
system, from the simple fact that by packing up with wife and
children and &lsquo;taking to the road,&rsquo; he thus escapes
taxes, rent, and the School-board officer.&nbsp; This they see,
and a &lsquo;few kind words&rsquo; and &lsquo;gentle
touches&rsquo; will never cause them to see it in any other
light.&nbsp; The sooner we get the ideal, fanciful, and romantic
side of a vagrant&rsquo;s and vagabond&rsquo;s life removed from
our vision, and see things as they really are, the better it will
be for us.&nbsp; For the life of me I cannot see anything
romantic in dirt, squalor, ignorance, and misery.&nbsp; Ministers
and missionaries have completely failed in the work, for the
simple reason that they have never begun it in earnest;
consequently, the schoolmaster and School-board officer must
begin to do their part in reclaiming these wandering tribes, and
this can only be done in the manner stated by me in my previous
letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the <i>Leicester Free Press</i> the following appeared on
August 16th:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, is
earning the title of the Children&rsquo;s Friend.&nbsp; His
&lsquo;Cry of the Brick-yard Children&rsquo; rang through
England, and issued in measures being adopted for their
protection.&nbsp; His description of the canal-boat children has
also resulted in legislation for their relief.&nbsp; Now I see
Mr. Smith has put in a good word for Gipsy children.&nbsp; It
will surprise a good many who seldom see or hear of these
Gipsies, except perhaps at the races, to find how numerous they
are even in this county.&nbsp; I do not think the number is at
all exaggerated.&nbsp; A few days ago while driving down a rural
lane in the country I &lsquo;interviewed&rsquo; one of these
children, who had run some hundreds of yards ahead, in order to
open a gate.&nbsp; At first the young, dark-eyed, swarthy damsel
declared she did not know how many brothers and sisters she had,
but on being asked to mention their names she rattled them over,
in quick succession, giving to each Christian name the surname of
Smith&mdash;thus, Charley Smith, Emma Smith, Fanny Smith, Bill
Smith, and the like, till she had enumerated either thirteen or
fifteen juvenile Smiths, all of whom lived with their parents in
a tent which was <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>pitched not far from the side of the
lane.&nbsp; Of education the child had had none, but she said she
went to church on a Sunday with her sister.&nbsp; This is a
sample of the kind of thing which prevails, and in his last
generous movement Mr. Smith, of Coalville, will be acting a good
part to numerous children who, although unable to claim
relationship, rejoice in the same patronymic as
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the <i>Derby Daily Telegraph</i>, under date August 16th,
the following leading article was published:&mdash;&ldquo;When
the social history of the present generation comes to be written
a prominent place among the list of practical philanthropists
will be assigned to George Smith, of Coalville.&nbsp; The man is
a humanitarian to the manner born.&nbsp; His character and
labours serve to remind us of the broad line which separates the
real apostle of benevolence from what may be termed the
&lsquo;professional&rsquo; sample.&nbsp; George Smith goes about
for the purpose of doing good, and&mdash;he does it.&nbsp; He
does not content himself with glibly talking of what needs to be
done, and what ought to be done.&nbsp; He prefers to act upon the
spirit of Mr. Wackford Squeers&rsquo; celebrated educational
principle.&nbsp; Having discovered a sphere of Christian duty he
goes and &lsquo;works&rsquo; it.&nbsp; Few more splendid
monuments of practical charity have been reared than the
amelioration of the social state of our canal population&mdash;an
achievement which has mainly been brought about by Mr.
Smith&rsquo;s indomitable perseverance and self-denial.&nbsp; A
few years ago we were accustomed to speak of the dwellers in
these floating hovels as beings who dragged out a degraded
existence in a far-off land.&nbsp; We were gloomily told that
they could not be reached.&nbsp; Orators at fashionable
missionary-meetings were wont to speak of them as irreclaimable
heathens who bid defiance to civilising influences from
impenetrable fastnesses.&nbsp; Mr. George Smith may be credited
with having broken down this discreditable state of things.&nbsp;
He brought us face to face with this unfortunate section of our
fellow-creatures, with what result it is not <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>necessary to
say.&nbsp; The sympathies of the public were effectually roused
by the narratives which revealed to us the deplorable depths of
human depravity into which vast numbers of English people had
fallen.&nbsp; The sufferings of the children in the gloomy,
pestiferous cabins used for &lsquo;living&rsquo; purposes
especially excited the country&rsquo;s pity.&nbsp; At this
present moment the lot of these poor waifs is far from being
inviting, but it is vastly different from what it was a short
time back.&nbsp; It was only a few days ago that the Duke of
Richmond, in reply to no less a personage than the Archbishop of
Canterbury, announced that express arrangements had been made by
the Government to meet the educational requirements of the once
helpless and neglected victims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Smith has now embarked upon a fresh crusade against
misery and ignorance.&nbsp; He has turned his attention from the
&lsquo;water Gipsies&rsquo; to their brethren ashore.&nbsp; He
has already began to busy himself with the condition of
&lsquo;our roadside arabs,&rsquo; as he calls them.&nbsp; We fear
Mr. Smith in prosecuting this good work of his is doomed to
perform a serious act of disenchantment.&nbsp; The ideal Gipsy is
destined to be scattered to the winds by the unvarnished picture
which Mr. Smith will cause to be presented to our vision.&nbsp;
He does not pretend to show us the romantic,
fantastically-dressed creature whose prototypes have long been in
the imaginations of many of us as types of the Gipsy
species.&nbsp; Those of our readers who have formed their notions
of Gipsy life upon the strength of the assurances which have been
given them by the late Mr. G. P. R. James and kindred writers
will find it hard to substitute for the joyous scenes of sunshine
and freedom he has associated with the nomadic existence, the
dull, wearisome round of squalor and wretchedness which is found,
upon examination, to constitute the principal condition of the
Gipsy tent.&nbsp; Whether it is that in this awfully prosaic
period of the world&rsquo;s history the picturesque and jovial
rascality which novelist and poet have insisted in connecting
with the Ishmaelites is stamped ruthlessly out of <!-- page
72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>being
by force of circumstances, it is barely possible to say.&nbsp;
Perhaps Gipsies, in common with other tribes of the romantic
past, have gradually become denuded of their old
attractiveness.&nbsp; It is, we confess, rather difficult to
believe that Bamfylde Moore Carew (wild, restless fellow though
he was) would persistently have linked his lot with that of the
poor, degraded, poverty-stricken wretches whom Mr. Smith has
taken in hand.&nbsp; Perchance it happens that our old heroes of
song and story have, so far as England is concerned, deteriorated
as a consequence of the money-making, business-like atmosphere
that they are compelled to breathe, and that with more favoured
climes they are to be seen in much of their primitive
glory.&nbsp; In Hungary, for instance, it is declared that Gipsy
life is pretty much what it is represented to be in our own
glowing pages of fiction.&nbsp; The late Major Whyte-Melville, in
a modern story declared to be founded on fact, introduces us to a
company of these continental wanderers who, with their beautiful
Queen, seem to invest the scenes from our old friend, &lsquo;The
Bohemian Girl,&rsquo; with something akin to probability.&nbsp;
But there is, of course, a limit to even Mr. Smith&rsquo;s
labours.&nbsp; Hungary is beyond his jurisdiction.&nbsp; He does
not pretend to carry his experience of the Gipsies further than
the Midlands.&nbsp; Derbyshire, Staffordshire, and our
neighbouring counties have offered him the examples he requires
with his new campaign.&nbsp; The lot of the roamers who eke out a
living in the adjacent lanes and roadways is, he explains to us,
as pitiful as anything of the sort well could be.&nbsp; The tent
of the Gipsy he finds to be as filthy and as repulsive as the
cabin of the canal-boat.&nbsp; Human beings of both sexes and of
all ages are huddled together without regard to comfort.&nbsp; As
a necessary sequence the women and children are the chief
sufferers in a social evil of this sort.&nbsp; The men are able
to rough it, but the weaker sex and their little charges are
reduced to the lowest paths of misery.&nbsp; Children are born,
suffer from disease, and die in the canvas hovels; and are
committed to the dust by the <!-- page 73--><a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>roadside.&nbsp; One old woman told Mr. Smith &lsquo;that
she had had sixteen children, fifteen of whom are alive, several
of them being born in a roadside tent.&nbsp; She says that she
was married out of one of these tents; and her brother died and
was buried out of a tent at Packington, near
Ashby-de-la-Zouch.&rsquo;&nbsp; The experience of this old crone
is akin to that of most of her class.&nbsp; She also tells Mr.
Smith that she could not read herself, and she did not believe
one in twenty could.&nbsp; Morally, as well as from a sanitary
point of view, Gipsy life, as it really exists, is a social
plague-spot, and consequently a social danger.&nbsp; Especially
does this contention apply to the children, of whom Mr. Smith
estimates that there are ten thousand roaming over the face of
the country as vagrants and vagabonds.&nbsp; It is to be hoped
many months will not be allowed to elapse before this difficulty
is seriously and successfully grappled with.&nbsp; Mr.
Smith&rsquo;s counsel as to the children is that &lsquo;living in
vans and tents and under old carts, if they are to be allowed to
live in these places they should be registered in a manner
analogous to the Canal Boats Act of 1877, so that the children
may be brought under the compulsory clauses of the Education
Acts, and become Christianised and civilised as other
children.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Duke of Richmond and his department
may do much to facilitate Mr. Smith&rsquo;s crusade without
temporising with the prejudices of red-tapeism.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Figaro</i> writes August 27th:&mdash;&ldquo;Our old friend
having successfully tackled the brick-yard children, and the
floating waifs and strays of our barge population, has now taken
the little Gipsies in hand, with a view of bringing them under
the supervision of the School Board system now general in this
country.&nbsp; He is a bold and energetic man, but we are bound
to say we doubt a little whether he will be able to tame the
offspring of the merry Zingara, and pass them all through the
regulation educational standard.&nbsp; Should he succeed, we
shall be thenceforth surprised at nothing, but be quite prepared
to hear that Mr. Smith has <!-- page 74--><a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>become
chairman of a society for changing the spots of the leopard, or
honorary director of an association for changing the
Ethiopian&rsquo;s skin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following letter from the Rev. J. Finch, a rural dean,
appeared in the <i>Standard</i>, August 30th:&mdash;&ldquo;The
following facts may not be without some interest to those who
have read the letters which have recently appeared in the pages
of the <i>Standard</i> respecting Gipsies.&nbsp; During the
thirty years I have been rector of this parish, members of the
Boswell family have been almost constantly resident here.&nbsp; I
buried the head of the family in 1874, who died at the age of
87.&nbsp; He was a regular attendant at the parish church, and
failed not to bow his head reverently when he entered within the
House of God.&nbsp; His burial was attended by several sons
resident, as Gipsies, in the Midland counties, and a headstone
marks the grave where his body rests.&nbsp; I never saw, or
heard, any harm of the man.&nbsp; He was a quiet and inoffensive
man, and worked industriously as a tinman within a short time of
his death.&nbsp; If he had rather a sharp eye for a little gift,
that is a trait of character by no means confined to
Gipsies.&nbsp; One of his daughters was married here to a member
of the Boswell tribe, and another, who rejoiced in the name of
Britannia, I buried in her father&rsquo;s grave two years
ago.&nbsp; After his death she and her mother removed to an
adjoining parish, where she was confirmed by Bishop Selwyn in
1876.&nbsp; Regular as was the old man at church, I never could
persuade his wife to come.&nbsp; In 1859 I baptized, privately,
an infant of the same tribe, whose parents were travelling
through the parish, and whose mother was named Elvira.&nbsp;
Great was the admiration of my domestics at the sight of the
beautiful lace which ornamented the robe in which the child was
brought to my house.&nbsp; Clearly there are Gipsies, and those
of a well-known tribe, glad to receive the ministrations of the
Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I next turned my steps towards London, having heard <!-- page
75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>that
Gipsies were to be found in the outskirts of this Babylon.&nbsp;
I set off early one morning in quest of them from my lodgings,
not knowing whither; but my earliest association came to my
relief.&nbsp; Knowing that Gipsies are generally to be found in
the neighbourhood of brick-yards, I took the &rsquo;bus to
Notting Hill, and after asking the policeman, for neither
clergyman or other ministers could tell me where they were to be
found, I wended my way to Wormwood Scrubs, and the following
letter, which appeared in the <i>Daily News</i>, September 6th of
last year, is the outcome of that &ldquo;run out,&rdquo; and is
as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;It has been the custom for years&mdash;I
might almost say centuries&mdash;when speaking of the Gipsies, to
introduce in one form or other during the conversation either
&lsquo;the King of the Gipsies,&rsquo; &lsquo;the Queen,&rsquo;
or some other member of &lsquo;the Royal Family.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
may surprise many of your readers who cling to the romantic side
of a Gipsy&rsquo;s life, and shut their eyes to the fearful
amount of ignorance, wretchedness, and misery there is amongst
them, to say that this extraordinary being is nothing but a
mythological jack-o&rsquo;-th&rsquo;-lantern, phantom of the
brain, illusion, the creation of lying tongues practising the art
of deception among some of the &lsquo;green horns&rsquo; in the
country lanes, or on the village greens.&nbsp; It is true there
are some &lsquo;horse-leeches&rsquo; among the Gipsies who have
got fat out of their less fortunate hedge-bottom brethren and the
British public, who delight in calling them either &lsquo;the
King,&rsquo; &lsquo;Queen,&rsquo; &lsquo;Prince,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Princess.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is true also that there are vast
numbers of the Gipsies who, with a chuckle, tongue in cheek, wink
of the eye, side grin and a sneer, say they have these important
personages amongst them; and if any little extra stir is being
made at a fair-time in the country lanes, in the neighbourhood of
straw-yards, they will be sure to tell them that either the
&lsquo;king,&rsquo; &lsquo;queen,&rsquo; or some member of the
&lsquo;royal family&rsquo; is being married or visiting them; and
nothing pleases the poor, ignorant Gipsies better than to get the
bystanders, with mouths open, <!-- page 76--><a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>to believe
their tales and lies.&nbsp; I should think that there is scarcely
a county in England but what a Gipsy king&rsquo;s or
queen&rsquo;s wedding has not taken place there within the last
twenty years.&nbsp; There was one in Bedfordshire not long since;
another at Epping Forest; and the last I heard of this wonderful
airy being was that he had taken up his head-quarters at the
Royal Hotel, Liverpool, and a carriage with eight wheels and six
piebald horses had been presented to him as a wedding present
from the Gipsies.&nbsp; Gipsy &lsquo;kings,&rsquo;
&lsquo;queens,&rsquo; and &lsquo;princes,&rsquo; their marriages
and deaths, are innumerable among the &lsquo;royal
family.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is equally believing in moonshine and
air-bubbles to believe that the Gipsies never speak of their
dead.&nbsp; There is a beautiful headstone put in a little
churchyard about two and a half miles from Barnet in memory of
the Brinkly family, and it is carefully looked after by members
of the family; one of the Lees has a tombstone erected to his
memory in Hanwell Cemetery; and such silly nonsense is put out by
the cunning, crafty Gipsies as &lsquo;dazzlers,&rsquo; to enable
them more readily to practise the art of lying and deception upon
their gullible listeners.&nbsp; Then again, with reference to the
Gipsies having a religion of their own.&nbsp; There is not a word
of truth in this imaginative notion prevalent in the minds or
some who have been trying to study their habits.&nbsp; Excepting
the language of some of the old-fashioned real Gipsies, and a few
other little peculiarities, any one studying the real hard facts
of a Gipsy&rsquo;s life with reference to the amount of
ignorance, and everything that is bad among them, will come to
the conclusion that there is much among them to compare very
unfavourably with the most neglected in our back streets and
slums.&nbsp; Of course, there are some good among them, as with
other &lsquo;ragamuffin&rsquo; ramblers.&nbsp; The following
particulars, related to me by a well-known Gipsy woman in the
neighbourhood of &lsquo;Wormwood Scrubs&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;North Pole,&rsquo; remarkable for her truthfulness,
honesty, and uprightness, will tend <!-- page 77--><a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>to show that
my previous statement as regards the amount of ignorance
prevalent among the poor Gipsy children has not been
over-stated.&nbsp; She has had six brothers and one sister, all
born in a tent, and only one of the eight could read a
little.&nbsp; She has had nine children born in a tent, four of
whom are alive, and only one could read and write a little.&nbsp;
She has seventeen grandchildren, and only two of them can read
and write a little, and thinks this a fair average of other Gipsy
children.&nbsp; She tells me that she got a most fat living for
more than twenty years by telling lies and fortunes to
servant-girls, old maids, and young men, mostly out of a book of
which she could not read a sentence, or tell a letter.&nbsp; She
said she had heard that I had taken up the cause of the poor
Gipsy children to get them educated, and, with hands uplifted and
tears in her eyes, which left no doubt of her meaning, said,
&lsquo;I do hope from the bottom of my heart that God will bless
and prosper you in the work till a law is passed, and the poor
Gipsy children are brought under the School Board, and their
parents compelled to send them to school as other people
are.&nbsp; The poor Gipsy children are poor, ignorant things, I
can assure you.&rsquo;&nbsp; She also said &lsquo;Does the Queen
wish all our poor Gipsy children to be educated?&rsquo;&nbsp; I
told her that the Queen took special interest in the children of
the working-classes, and was always pleased to hear of their
welfare.&nbsp; Again, with tears trickling down her face, she
said, &lsquo;I do thank the Lord for such a good Queen, and for
such a noble-hearted woman.&nbsp; I do bless her.&nbsp; Do Thou,
&lsquo;Lord, bless her!&rsquo;&nbsp; After some further
conversation, and taking dinner with her in her humble way in the
van, she said she hoped I would not be insulted if she offered
me, as from a poor Gipsy woman, a shilling to help me in the work
of getting a law passed to compel the Gipsies to send their
children to school.&nbsp; I took the shilling, and, after making
her a present of a copy of the new edition of my &lsquo;Cry of
the Children from the Brick-yards of England,&rsquo; which she
wrapped in a <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>beautiful white cloth, and after a
shake of the hand, we parted, hoping to meet again on some future
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foregoing letter brought forth the following letter from
Mr. Daniel Gorrie, and appeared in the <i>Daily News</i> under
date September 13th, as under:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. George Smith,
Coalville, Leicester, whose letter on the above subject appears
in your impression to-day, succeeded so well in his efforts on
behalf of the poor slave-children of the Midland brick-yards,
that it is to be hoped he will attain equal success in drawing
attention to the pitiful condition of the Gipsy children, who are
allowed to grow up as ignorant as savages that never saw the face
nor heard the voice of a Christian missionary.&nbsp; In one of
the late Thomas Aird&rsquo;s poems, entitled &lsquo;A Summer
Day,&rsquo; there are some lines which, with your permission, I
should like to quote, that are in perfect accord with Mr.
Smith&rsquo;s wise and kindly suggestion.&nbsp; The lines are
these:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In yonder sheltered nook of nibbled
sward,<br />
Beside the wood, a Gipsy band are camped;<br />
And there they&rsquo;ll sleep the summer night away.<br />
By stealthy holes their ragged, brawny brood<br />
Creep through the hedges, in their pilfering quest<br />
Of sticks and pales to make their evening fire.<br />
Untutored things scarce brought beneath the laws<br />
And meek provisions of this ancient State.<br />
Yet is it wise, with wealth and power like hers,<br />
To let so many of her sons grow up<br />
In untaught darkness and consecutive vice?<br />
True, we are jealous, free, and hate constraint<br />
And every cognisance, o&rsquo;er private life;<br />
Yet, not to name a higher principle,<br />
&rsquo;Twere but an institute of wise police<br />
That every child, neglected of its own,<br />
State claimed should be, State seized and taught and trained<br
/>
To social duty and to Christian life.<br />
Our liberties have limbs, manifold;<br />
So let the national will, which makes restraint<br />
Part of its freedom, oft the soundest part,<br />
Power-arm the State to do the large design.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>&ldquo;The above lines, I may add, were written by the
poet (in losing whom Mr. Thomas Carlyle lost one of his oldest
and most valued friends) many, many years before the Education
Acts now in force came into existence.&nbsp; As many parents
might not like the idea of Gipsy children attending the same
Board schools as their own, would it not be possible to establish
special schools in those parts of the Midland counties where
Gipsies &lsquo;most do congregate&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which I replied as under, in the <i>Daily News</i> bearing
date September 13th:&mdash;&ldquo;In reply to Mr. Gorrie&rsquo;s
letter which appears in your issue of this morning, I consider
that it would be unwise and impracticable to build separate
schools for either the brick-yard, canal-boat, Gipsy, or other
children moving about the country, in tents, vans, &amp;c., for
their use solely; especially would it be so in the case of Gipsy
children and roadside arabs.&nbsp; What I have been and am still
aiming at is the education of these children, not by isolating
them from other working-classes&mdash;colliers, potters,
ironworkers, factory hands, tradesmen, &amp;c.&mdash;but by
bringing them in daily contact with the children of these
parents, and also under some of the influences of our little
missionary civilisers who are brought up and receiving some of
their education in drawing-rooms, and whose parents cannot afford
to send them to boarding-schools, colleges, &amp;c., and have to
content themselves by having their children educated at either
the national, British, or Board schools.&nbsp; I confess that it
is not pleasant to hear that our children have picked up vulgar
words at school; and it requires patience, care, and watchfulness
on the part of parents to counteract some of the downward
tendencies resulting from an uneven mixing of children brought up
and educated under such influences.&nbsp; Better by far put up
with these little ills than others we know not of, the outcome of
ignorance.&nbsp; On the other hand, it is pleasing to note how
glad the parents of Gipsy, canal-boat, and brick-yard children
are when their children pick up &lsquo;fine words&rsquo; and
become more &lsquo;gentlerified&rsquo; by mixing with <!-- page
80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>children higher up the social scale.&nbsp; Bad habits,
words, and actions are generally picked up between school
times.&nbsp; It would be well for us to rub down class feeling
among children as much as possible as regards their
education.&nbsp; The children of brick-makers, canal-boatmen, and
Gipsies are of us and with us, and must be taken hold of,
educated, and elevated in things pertaining to their future
welfare.&nbsp; The &lsquo;turning up of the nose,&rsquo; by those
whose duty, education, and privilege should have taught them
better things, at these poor children has had more to do in
bringing about their pitiable and ignorant condition than can be
imagined.&nbsp; The Canal Boats Act, if wisely carried out, will
before long bring about the education of the canal-boat children;
and in order to bring the Gipsy children, show children, and
other roadside arabs under the Education Acts, I am seeking to
have all movable habitations, <i>i.e.</i>, tents, vans, shows,
&amp;c., in which the families live who are earning a living by
travelling from place to place, registered and numbered, as in
the case of canal-boats, and the parents compelled &lsquo;by hook
or by crook&rsquo; to send their children to school at the place
wherever they may be temporarily located, be it national,
British, or Board school.&nbsp; The education of these children
should be brought about at all risks and inconveniences, or we
may expect a blacker page in the social history of this country
opening to our view than we have seen for many a long
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following leading article upon Gipsies and other tramps of
a similar class appeared in the <i>Standard</i>, September 10th,
1879, and as it relates to the subject I have in hand I quote it
in full:&mdash;&ldquo;Not only in his &lsquo;Uncommercial
Traveller,&rsquo; but in many other scattered passages of his
works, Dickens, who for many years lived in Kent, has described
the intolerable nuisance inflicted by tramps upon residents in
the home counties, and has sketched the natural history of the
sturdy vagabond who infests our roads and highways from early
spring to late <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>autumn, with a minuteness and power
of detail worthy of a Burton.&nbsp; The subject of vagabondage is
not, however, confined in its interest to the Metropolis and its
adjacent parts.&nbsp; In the United States the habitual beggar
has become as serious a nuisance, and, indeed, source of positive
danger, as he was once amongst ourselves; and in the State of
Pennsylvania more especially it has been found necessary to pass
what may be described as an Habitual Vagrants Act for his
suppression.&nbsp; That the terms of this enactment should be
excessively severe is hardly matter of astonishment, when we bear
in mind the fate of little Charley Ross.&nbsp; Early in the year
1874 a couple of men who were travelling up and down the country
in a waggon stole from the home of his parents in Germantown,
Pennsylvania, a boy of some seven years named Charley Ross.&nbsp;
They then sent letters demanding a large sum of money for his
restoration.&nbsp; The ransom increased, until no less than
twenty thousand dollars was insisted upon.&nbsp; While the
parents, on the one hand, were attempting to raise the money, and
while the police were endeavouring to arrest the kidnappers, all
negotiations fell through.&nbsp; The two men believed to have
been concerned in the abduction were shot down in the act of
committing a burglary on Rhode Island, and from that day to this
the fate of Charley Ross has remained a mystery.&nbsp; Under
these circumstances, public opinion has naturally run high, and
it has been provided that any habitual tramp making his way from
place to place, without earning an honest livelihood, shall be
liable to imprisonment with hard labour for a period of twelve
months; and that tramps who enter dwellings without permission,
who carry fire-arms, or other weapons, or who threaten to injure
either persons or property, shall be put to work in the common
penitentiary for a period of three years.&nbsp; Pennsylvania in
this is but reverting to the old law of England in the Tudor
days.&nbsp; In the time of Henry VIII. vagrants were whipped at
the cart&rsquo;s tail, without distinction of either sex or
age.&nbsp; The whipping-post, <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>together with
the stocks, was a conspicuous ornament of every parish green, and
it was not until the year 1791 that the whipping of women was
expressly forbidden by statute.&nbsp; There were other enactments
even more severe.&nbsp; By an act of Elizabeth idle soldiers and
marines, or persons pretending to be soldiers or marines,
wandering about the realm, were held <i>ipso facto</i> guilty of
felony, and hundreds of such offenders were publicly
executed.&nbsp; Another act of the same kind was directed against
Gipsies, by which any Gipsy, or any person over fourteen who had
been seen or found in their fellowship, was guilty of felony if
he remained a month in the kingdom; and in Hale&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Pleas of the Crown&rsquo; we learn that at one Suffolk
Assizes no less than thirteen Gipsies were executed on the
strength of this barbarous act, and without any other reason or
cause whatever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ancient severity of our Statute Book has long since
been modified, and the worst that can now befall &lsquo;idle
persons and vagabonds, such as wake on the night and sleep on the
day, and haunt customable taverns and ale-houses, and routs
about; and no man wot from whence they come ne whither they
go,&rsquo; is a brief period of hard labour under the provisions
of the Vagrant Act.&nbsp; Under this comprehensive statute are
swept together as into one common net a vast variety of petty
offenders, of whom some are deemed &lsquo;idle and disorderly
persons,&rsquo; other &lsquo;rogues and vagabonds,&rsquo; and
others again &lsquo;incorrigible rogues.&rsquo;&nbsp; Under one
or other of these heads are unlicensed hawkers or pedlars;
persons wandering abroad to beg or causing any child to beg;
persons lodging in any outhouse or in the open air, not having
any visible means of subsistence, and not giving a good account
of themselves; persons playing or betting in the public street;
and notorious thieves loitering about with intent to commit a
felony.&nbsp; At the present period of the year the country in
the neighbourhood not of the Metropolis alone, but of all large
towns, is filled with offenders of this kind.&nbsp; Indeed, the
sturdy tramp renders the country to a <!-- page 83--><a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>very great
extent unsafe for ladies who have ventured to go about without
protection.&nbsp; Ostensibly he is a vendor of combs, or
bootlaces, or buttons, or is in quest of a hop-picking job, or is
a discharged soldier or sailor, or a labourer out of
employment.&nbsp; But whatever may be his pretence, his mode of
procedure is more or less the same.&nbsp; If he can come upon a
roadside cottage left in the charge of a woman, or possibly only
of a young girl, he will demand food and money, and if the demand
be not instantly complied with will never hesitate at
violence.&nbsp; Indeed, when we remember how many horrible
outrages have within the last few years been committed by
ruffians of this kind, it is quite easy to understand the
severity necessary in less civilised times.&nbsp; Only recently
the Spaniard Garcia murdered an entire family in Wales; and some
few years ago, at Denham, near Uxbridge, a small household was
butchered for the sake of a few shillings and such little plunder
as the humble cottage afforded.&nbsp; And although grave crimes
of this kind are happily rare, and tend to become rarer, petty
violence is far from uncommon.&nbsp; Many ladies resident in the
country can tell how they have been beset upon the highway by
sturdy tramps of forbidding aspect, to whom, in despair, they
have given alms to an amount which practically made the
solicitation an act of brigandage.&nbsp; The farmer&rsquo;s wife
and the bailiff tell us how haystacks are converted into
temporary lodging-houses, chickens stolen, and outbuildings
plundered.&nbsp; Only too often the rogues are in direct league
with the worst offenders in London.&nbsp; Whitechapel supplies a
large contingent of the Kentish hop-pickers, and the
&lsquo;traveller&rsquo; who is ostensibly in search of a
haymaking or hopping job is, as often as not, spying out the
land, and planning profitable burglaries to be carried out in
winter with the aid of his colleagues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is, no doubt, much about the tramp that is
picturesque.&nbsp; A romantic imagination pictures him as a sort
of peripatetic philosopher, with more of Jacques in him than of
Autolycus; living in constant communion with <!-- page 84--><a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>Nature;
sleeping in the open air; subsisting on the scantiest fare;
slaking his thirst at the running brook; and only begging to be
allowed to live his own childlike and innocent life, as
purposeless as the butterflies, as happy as the swallows, as
destitute of all worldly ends and aims as are the very violets of
the hedge-row.&nbsp; &AElig;sthetic enthusiasm of this kind is
apt to be severely checked by the prosaic realities of actual
existence.&nbsp; The tramp, like the noble savage, is a relic of
uncivilised life with which we can very well afford to
dispense.&nbsp; There is no appreciation of the country about
him; no love of Nature for its own sake.&nbsp; In winter he
becomes an inmate of the workhouse, where he almost always proves
himself turbulent and disorderly.&nbsp; As soon as it becomes
warm enough to sleep in a haystack, or under a hedge, or in a
thick clump of furze and bracken, he discharges himself from
&lsquo;the Union&rsquo; and takes to &lsquo;the
roads.&rsquo;&nbsp; From town to town he begs or steals his way,
safe in the assurance that should things go amiss the nearest
workhouse must always provide him with gratuitous board and
lodging.&nbsp; Work of any kind, although he vigorously pretends
to be in &lsquo;want of a job,&rsquo; is utterly abhorrent to
him.&nbsp; Home county farmers, led by that unerring instinct
which is the unconscious result of long experience, know the
tramp at once, and can immediately distinguish him from the
<i>bon&acirc;-fide</i> &lsquo;harvester,&rsquo; in quest of
honest employment.&nbsp; The tramp, indeed, is the sturdy idler
of the roads&mdash;a cousin-german of the
&lsquo;beach-comber,&rsquo; who is the plague of consuls and
aversion of merchant skippers.&nbsp; In almost every port of any
size the harbour is beset by a gang of idle fellows, whose
pretence is that they are anxious to sign articles for a voyage,
but who are, in reality, living from hand to mouth.&nbsp;
Captains know only too well that the true
&lsquo;beach-comber&rsquo; is always incompetent, often
physically unfit for work, and constitutionally mutinous.&nbsp;
When his other resources fail, he throws himself upon the nearest
consul of the nation to which he may claim to belong, and a very
<!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>considerable sum is yearly wasted in providing such
ramblers with free passages to what they please to assert is the
land of their birth.&nbsp; Harbour-masters and port authorities
generally are apt to treat notorious offenders of this kind
somewhat summarily, and our local police and poor-law officers
are ill-advised if they do not follow the good example thus set,
and show the tramp as little mercy as possible.&nbsp; Leniency,
indeed, of any kind he simply regards as weakness.&nbsp; He would
be a highwayman if the existing conditions of society allowed it,
and if he had the necessary personal courage.&nbsp; As it is, he
is a blot upon our country life, and an eyesore on our
roads.&nbsp; Vagabondage is not a heritage with him, as it is
with the genuine Gipsies.&nbsp; He has taken to it from choice,
and the true-bred Romany will always regard him with contempt, as
a mere migratory gaol bird, who knows no tongue of the roads
beyond the cant or &lsquo;kennick&rsquo; of thieves&mdash;a
Whitechapel <i>argot</i>, familiarity with which at once tells
its own tale.&nbsp; Fortunately, our existing law is sufficient
to keep the nuisance in check, if only it be resolutely
administered.&nbsp; The tramp, however, trades upon spurious
sympathy.&nbsp; There will always be weak-minded folk to pity the
poor man whom the hard-hearted magistrates have sent to gaol for
sleeping under a haystack&mdash;forgetting that this interesting
offender is, as a rule, no better than a common thief at large,
who will steal whatever he can lay his hands on, and who makes
our lanes and pleasant country byways unpleasant, if not actually
dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foregoing article upon Gipsies and tramps brought from a
correspondent in the <i>Standard</i>, under date September 12th,
the following letter:&mdash;&ldquo;I have just been reading the
article in your paper on the subject of tramps.&nbsp; If you
could stand at my gate for one day, you would be astonished to
see the number of tramps passing through our village, which is on
the high road between two of the principal towns in South
Yorkshire; and the same may be <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>said of any
place in England situated on the main road, or what was formerly
the coach road.&nbsp; We seldom meet tramps in town, except
towards evening, when they come in for the casual ward.&nbsp;
They spend their day in the country, passing from one town to
another, and to those who reside near the high road, as I do,
they are an intolerable nuisance.&nbsp; A tramp in a ten mile
journey, which occupies him all day, will frequently make 1s. 6d.
or 2s. a day, besides being supplied with food, and the more
miserable and wretched he can make himself appear, the more
sympathy he will get, and if he is lucky enough to meet a
benevolent old lady out for her afternoon drive he will get 6d.
or 1s. from her.&nbsp; She will say &lsquo;Poor man,&rsquo; and
then go home thinking how she has helped &lsquo;that poor,
wretched man&rsquo; on his way.&nbsp; Tramps are a class of
people who never have worked, and who never will, except it be in
prison, and, as long as they can get a living for nothing, they
will continue to be, as you say in your article, &lsquo;A blot
upon the country and an eyesore on our roads.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always find the quickest way of getting rid of a
tramp is to threaten him with the police, and I am quite sure if
every householder would make a rule never to relieve tramps with
money, and only those who are crippled, with food, the number
would soon be decreased.&nbsp; If people have any old clothes or
spare coppers to give away, I am sure they will soon find in
their own town or village many cases more worthy of their charity
than the highway tramp.&nbsp; I do not recommend anybody to find
a tramp even temporary employment, unless they can stand over him
and then see the man safe off the premises, and even then he may
come again at night as a burglar; but I am sure work could be
found at 1s. 6d. or 2s. a day by our corporations or on the
highways, where, under proper supervision, these idle vagabonds
would be made to earn an honest living.&nbsp; You will find that
nine out of ten tramps have been in prison and have no character,
and although they may say they <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>&lsquo;want
work,&rsquo; they really do not mean it.&nbsp; Not long ago I
caught a great rough fellow trying to get the dinner from a
little girl who was taking it to her father at his work.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Poor man! he must have been very hungry,&rsquo; I fancy I
hear the benevolent old lady saying.&nbsp; Of course, during the
last year we have had many men &lsquo;on the road&rsquo; who are
really in search of work, but I always tell them that there is as
much work in one place as another, and unless they really have a
situation in view they should not go tramping from town to
town.&nbsp; Many of them have no characters to produce, and I
expect when they find &lsquo;tramping&rsquo; is such a pleasant
and easy mode of living they will join the ranks and become
roadsters also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In <i>May&rsquo;s Aldershot Advertiser</i>, September 13th,
1879, the following is a leading article upon the condition of
Gipsies:&mdash;&ldquo;The incoming of September reminds us that
in the hop districts this is the season of advent of those
British nomads&mdash;the Gipsies, the only class for whom there
is so little legislation, or with whose actions and habits,
lawless as they are, the agents of the law so seldom
interfere.&nbsp; The miners of the Black Country owe the
suppression of juvenile labour and the short time law to the long
exertions of the generous-hearted Richard Oastler.&nbsp; The
brickmaker may no longer debase and ruin, both morally and
physically, his child of the tender age of nine or ten years, by
turning it&mdash;boy or girl&mdash;into the brick-yard to toil,
shoeless and ragged, at carrying heavy lumps on its head.&nbsp;
The canal population&mdash;they who are born and die in the
circumscribed hole at the end of a barge, dignified by the name
of &lsquo;cabin,&rsquo; are just now receiving the special
attention of Mr. Smith, of Coalville, and certainly, excepting
the section of whom I am writing, there is not to be found in
privileged England a people so utterly debased and regardless of
the characteristics of civilised life.&nbsp; The Factory Act
prevents the employing of boys or girls under a certain age, and
secures for those who are legally employed a sufficient time <!--
page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>for recreation.&nbsp; But who cares for, or thinks
about, the wandering Romany?&nbsp; True, Police-Constable Argus
receives authority by which he, <i>sans
c&eacute;r&eacute;monie</i>, commands them to &lsquo;move
on,&rsquo; should he come across any by the roadside in his
diurnal or nocturnal perambulations.&nbsp; But it often occurs
that the object for which they &lsquo;camped&rsquo; in the spot
has been accomplished.&nbsp; The farmer&rsquo;s hedge has been
made to supply them with fuel for warmth and for culinary
purposes; his field has been trespassed upon, and fodder stolen
for their overworked and cruelly-treated quadrupeds; so, the
&lsquo;move on&rsquo; simply means a little inconvenience
resulting from their having to transfer their paraphernalia to
another &lsquo;camp ground&rsquo; not far off.&nbsp; They also
enjoy certain immunities which are withheld from other
classes.&nbsp; Excepting that some of them pay for a
hawker&rsquo;s licence, they roam about as they list, untaxed and
uncontrolled, though the earnings of most of them amount to a
considerable sum every year; as they are free from the
conventional rule which requires the house-dwelling population,
often at great inconvenience, to &lsquo;keep up
appearances,&rsquo; it often happens that the wearer of the most
tattered garments earns the most money.&nbsp; They can and do
live sparingly, and spend lavishly.&nbsp; The labour which they
choose is the most remunerative kind.&nbsp; Ploughing or
stone-breaking is not the employment, which the Gipsy usually
seeks!&nbsp; He takes the cream and leaves the skimmed milk for
the cottier, and having done all there is to do of the kind he
chooses, he is off to some other money-making industry.&nbsp; A
Gipsy will make four harvests in one year; first he goes
&lsquo;up the country,&rsquo; as he calls going into Middlesex,
for &lsquo;peas-hacking.&rsquo;&nbsp; That over, he goes into
Sussex (Chichester&mdash;&rsquo;wheat-fagging&rsquo; or tying),
and on that being done, returns toward Hampshire&mdash;North
Hants&mdash;to &lsquo;fag&rsquo; or tie, and that being done he
enters Surrey for hop-picking (previously securing a
&lsquo;bin&rsquo; in one of the gardens).&nbsp; Some idea of his
gross earnings may be obtained from the following fact:&mdash;Two
able-bodied men, an old woman of <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>about 75
years of age, and two women, earned on a farm in one harvest, no
less than &pound;42.&nbsp; After that, they went hop-picking,
and, in answer to my question, &lsquo;How much will they earn
there?&rsquo; the farmer, who is a hop-grower, said, &lsquo;More
than they have here.&rsquo;&nbsp; These operations were performed
in less than a quarter of the year.&nbsp; In the places through
which they pass to their work they sell what they can, and at
night pitch their tent or draw their van on some common or waste
land, buy no corn for their horses, nor spend any money for coal
or wood.&nbsp; If they locate themselves on the margin of a wood,
and make a prolonged sojourn, the uproar, the screams, the cries
of &lsquo;murder&rsquo; heard from their rendezvous</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Make night hideous.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this, and more, they do with impunity.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is
only the Gipsies quarrelling.&rsquo;&nbsp; No inspector of
nuisances pays them a visit; the tax-gatherer knows not their
whereabouts; the rate-collector troubles them not with any
&lsquo;demand note;&rsquo; their children are not provided with
proper and necessary education, yet no school attendance officer
serves them with a summons.&nbsp; Their existence is not known
officially, saving the time a census is taken, when, at the
<i>expense of the house-dwellers</i>, a registry is made of
them.&nbsp; Not a farthing do they contribute to the government,
imperial or local, though many of them are in a position to do
it, and can, without inconvenience, find from &pound;40 to
&pound;80; or &pound;100 for a new-travelling van when they want
one.&nbsp; Overcrowding and numerous indecencies exist in galore
among them, yet no representative of the Board of Health troubles
himself about the number of cubic feet of air per individual
there may be in their tent or van.&nbsp; Is this neglect,
indifference, obliviousness, or do the authorities believe that
the impurities and unsanitary exhalements are sufficiently
oxidised to prevent any disease?&nbsp; It is worthy of remark
that they are not liable to the epidemics which afflict
others.&nbsp; The loss of a <!-- page 90--><a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>pony from a
common simultaneously with their exodus is a suspicious fact
occasionally.&nbsp; They live in defiance of social, moral,
civil, and natural law, a disgrace to the legislature.&mdash;J.
W. B.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the <i>Hand and Heart</i>, September 19th of last year, the
editor says, with reference to our roadside
arabs:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, whose efforts
to better the condition of the wretched canal population have met
deserved success, draws attention to the state of another
neglected class.&nbsp; Parliament, he says, which has lately been
reforming so many things, would have done well to consider the
case of the Gipsies, &lsquo;our roadside arabs.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of
the idleness, ignorance, heathenism, and general misery
prevailing among these strange people he gives some curious
instances.&nbsp; One old man, whose acquaintance Mr. Smith made,
calculates that &lsquo;there are about 250 families of Gipsies in
ten of the Midland counties, and thinks that a similar proportion
will be found in the rest of the United Kingdom.&nbsp; He has
seen as many as ten tents of Gipsies within a distance of five
miles.&nbsp; He thinks there will be an average of five children
in each tent.&nbsp; He has seen as many as ten or twelve children
in some tents, and not many of them able to read or write.&nbsp;
His child of six months old&mdash;with his wife ill at the same
time in the tent&mdash;sickened, died, and was &ldquo;laid
out&rdquo; by him, and it was also buried out of one of those
wretched abodes on the roadside at Barrow-upon-Soar, last
January.&nbsp; When the poor thing died he had not sixpence in
his pocket.&rsquo;&nbsp; An old woman bore similar
testimony.&nbsp; &lsquo;She said that she had had sixteen
children, fifteen of whom are alive, several of them being born
in a roadside tent.&nbsp; She says that she was married out of
one of these tents; and her brother died and was buried out of a
tent at Packington, near Ashby-de-la-Zouch.&nbsp; This poor woman
knows about three hundred families of Gipsies in eleven of the
Midland and Eastern counties, and has herself, so she says, four
lots <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>of Gipsies travelling in Lincolnshire at the present
time.&nbsp; She said she could not read herself, and thinks that
not one Gipsy in twenty can.&nbsp; She has travelled all her
life.&nbsp; Her mother, named Smith, of whom there are not a few,
is the mother of fifteen children, all of whom were born in a
tent.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Smith&rsquo;s conclusion (which will not
be disputed) is that &lsquo;to have between three and four
thousand men and women, and eight or ten thousand children
classed in the Census as vagrants and vagabonds, roaming all over
the country, in ignorance and evil training that carries peril
with it, is not a pleasant look-out for the future.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He contends that &lsquo;if these poor children, living in vans
and tents and under old carts, are to be allowed to live in these
places, they should be registered in a manner analogous to the
Canal Boats Act of 1877, so that the children may be brought
under the compulsory clauses of the Education Acts, and become
Christianised and civilised as other children.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Illustrated London News</i>, October 4th,
says:&mdash;&ldquo;Among the papers to be read at Manchester is
one on the condition of the Gipsy children and roadside
&lsquo;arabs&rsquo; in our midst, by Mr. George Smith, of
Coalville, Leicester.&nbsp; Here, indeed, is a gentleman who is
certainly neither a dealer in crotchets nor a rider of
hobbies.&nbsp; Mr. Smith has done admirable service on behalf of
the poor children on board our barges and canal-boats, and the
even more pitiable boys and girls in our brick-fields; and to his
philanthropic exertions are mainly due the recent amendments in
the Factory Acts regulating the labour of young children.&nbsp;
He has now taken the case of the juvenile &lsquo;Romanies&rsquo;
in hand; and I wish him well in his benevolent crusade.&nbsp; Mr.
Smith has obligingly sent me a proof of his address, from which I
gather that, owing to a superstitious dislike which the Gipsies
entertain towards the Census, and the successfully cunning
attempts on their part to baffle the enumerators, it is only by
conjecture and guesswork that we can form any idea of the number
of Bohemians in this country.&nbsp; The <!-- page 92--><a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>result of Mr.
Smith&rsquo;s diligent inquiries has led him to the assumption
that there are not less than 4,000 Gipsy men and women, and from
15,000 to 20,000 Gipsy and &lsquo;arab&rsquo;&mdash;that is to
say, tramp&mdash;children roaming about the country
&lsquo;outside the educational laws and the pale of
civilisation.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following leading article, relating to my paper upon
&ldquo;The Condition of the Gipsy Children,&rdquo; appears in the
<i>Daily News</i>, October 6th:&mdash;&ldquo;At the Social
Science Congress Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, will to-morrow
open a fresh campaign of philanthropy.&nbsp; The philanthropic
Alexander is seldom in the unhappy condition of his Macedonian
original, and generally has plenty of worlds remaining ready to
be conquered.&nbsp; Brick-yards and canal-boats have not
exhausted Mr. Smith&rsquo;s energies, and the field he has now
entered upon is wider and perhaps harder to work than either of
these.&nbsp; Mr. Smith desires to bring the Gipsy children under
the operation of the Education Act.&nbsp; Education and Gipsies
seem at first sight to be words mutually contradictory.&nbsp;
Amid the mass of imaginative fiction, idle speculation, and
deliberate forgery that has been set afloat on the subject of the
Gipsies, one thing has been made tolerably clear, and that is the
intense aversion which the pure bred Gipsy has to any of the
restraints of civilised life.&nbsp; Whether those restraints take
the form of orderly and cleanly living in houses of brick and of
stone, or of military service, or of school attendance, is pretty
much a matter of indifference to him.&nbsp; Schools, indeed, may
be regarded from the Gipsy point of view as not merely irksome,
but useless institutions.&nbsp; Our most advanced places of
technical education do not teach fortune-telling, or that
interesting branch of the tinker&rsquo;s art which enables the
practitioner in mending one hole in a kettle to make two.&nbsp;
Except for music the Gipsies do not seem to have much aptitude
for the arts; they are more or less indifferent to literature;
and business, except of certain dubious kinds, is a detestable
thing to them.&nbsp; Their vagrant habits, on the other hand,
enable them, without much difficulty, to evade <!-- page 93--><a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>the great
commandment which has gone forth, that all the English world
shall be examined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The condition of the Gipsies is a sufficiently gloomy
one.&nbsp; We may pass over those degenerate members of the race
who have elected to pitch permanent tents in the slums and
rookeries of great towns, because, in the first place, they are
degenerate, and in the second, their children ought to be within
reach of School Board visitors who do their duty
diligently.&nbsp; It is only the Gipsy proper who has the
opportunity of evading this vigilance.&nbsp; His opportunity is
an excellent one, and he fully avails himself of it.&nbsp; Gipsy
households, if they can be so called, are of the most fluid, not
to say intangible character.&nbsp; The partnerships between men
and women are rarely of a legal kind, and the constant habit of
aliases and double names make identification still more
difficult.&nbsp; As a rule, the race is remarkably prolific, and
though the hardships to which young children are exposed thin it
considerably, the proportion of children to adults is still very
large.&nbsp; Hawking, their chief ostensible occupation, cannot
legally be practised until the age of seventeen, and until that
time the Gipsy child has nothing to do except to sprawl and loaf
about the camp, and to indulge in his own devices.&nbsp; Idleness
and ignorance, unless the whole race of moralists have combined
to represent things falsely, are the parents of every sort of
vice, and the average Gipsy child would appear to be brought up
in a condition which is the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of both.&nbsp;
It is true that Gipsies do not very often make their appearance
in courts of justice, but this is partly owing to the cunning
with which their peccadilloes are practised, partly to their
well-known habit of sticking by one another, and still more to
the mild but very definite terrorism which they exercise.&nbsp;
Country residents, when a Gipsy encampment comes near them, know
that a certain amount of blackmail in this way or that has to be
paid, and that in their own time the strangers, if not interfered
with, will go.&nbsp; Interference with them is apt to bring down
a <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>visit from that very unpleasant fowl, the &lsquo;red
cock,&rsquo; whose crowings usually cost a good deal more than a
stray chicken here and a vanished blanket there.&nbsp; So the
Ishmaelites are left pretty much alone to wander about from
roadside patch to roadside patch to pick up a living somehow or
other, and to exist in the condition of undisturbed freedom and
filth which appears to be all that they desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gloss has long been taken off the picture which
imaginative persons used to varnish for themselves as to the
Romany.&nbsp; Nor, perhaps is any country in Europe so little
fitted for these gentry as ours.&nbsp; England is every year
becoming more and more enclosed, and the spaces which are not
enclosed are more and more carefully looked after.&nbsp; Whether
in our climate open-air living was ever thoroughly satisfactory
is a question not easy to answer.&nbsp; But even if we admit that
it might have been merry in good greenwood under the conditions
picturesquely described in ballads, the admission does not extend
to the present day.&nbsp; There is no good greenwood now, except
a few insignificant patches, which are pretty sharply preserved;
and the killing of game, except on a small scale and at
considerable risk, is difficult.&nbsp; The cheapness of modern
manufactures has interfered a good deal with the various trades
of mending, mankind having made up their minds that it is better
to buy new things and throw them away when they fail than to have
them patched and cobbled.&nbsp; Fortune-telling is a resource to
some extent, but even this is meddled with by the Gorgio and his
laws.&nbsp; The <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of the vagabond
Gipsy is getting smaller and smaller in England, and as this goes
on the likelihood of his practices becoming more and more
undisguisedly criminal is obvious.&nbsp; The best way to prevent
this is, of course, to catch him young and educate him.&nbsp; A
century or two ago the innate Bohemianism of the race might have
made this difficult, if not impossible.&nbsp; But it is clear
that even if the Gipsy blood has not been largely crossed during
their four centuries of residence in England, <!-- page 95--><a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>other
influences have been sufficient to work upon them.&nbsp; If they
can live in towns at all, they can live in them after the manner
of civilised townsmen.&nbsp; A Gipsy at school suggests odd
ideas, and one might expect that the pupils would imitate some
day or other, though less tragically, the conduct of that
promising South African prince who, the other day, solemnly took
off his trousers (as a more decisive way of shaking our dust from
his feet), and began vigorously to kill colonists.&nbsp; But it
is by no means certain that this would be the case.&nbsp; The old
order of Gipsy life has, in England, at any rate, become
something of an impossibility and everything of a nuisance.&nbsp;
It has ceased to be even picturesque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following is a copy of my paper upon the &ldquo;Condition
of Gipsy Children,&rdquo; as read by me before the Social Science
Congress, held at Manchester on October 7th, 1879.&nbsp; Although
it was at the &ldquo;fag end&rdquo; of the session, and the last
paper but two, it was evident the announcement in the papers that
my paper was to be read on Tuesday morning had created a little
interest in the Gipsy children question, for immediately I began
to read it in the large room, under the presidency of Dr.
Haviland, it was manifest I was to be honoured with a large
audience, so much so, that, before I had proceeded very far with
it, the hall was nearly full of merchant princes&mdash;who could
afford to leave their bags of gold and cotton&mdash;and ladies
and gentlemen desirous of listening to my humble tale of
neglected humanity, and the outcasts of society, commonly called
&ldquo;Gipsies&rsquo; children.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Gladstone, of
the London School Board, opened the discussion and said that he
could, from his own observation and knowledge of the persons I
had quoted, testify to the truthfulness of my remarks.&nbsp; Dr.
Fox, of London, Mr. H. H. Collins, Mr. Crofton, and other
gentlemen took part in the discussion, and it was the unanimous
feeling of those present that something should be done to remedy
this sad state of things; and the chairman said that the result
of my labours with regard to the Gipsies would be that something
<!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>would be done in the way of legislation.&nbsp; The paper
caused some excitement in the country, and was copied lengthily
into many of the daily papers, including the <i>Leicester Daily
Post</i>, <i>Leicester Daily Mercury</i>, <i>Nottingham
Guardian</i>, <i>Nottingham Journal</i>, <i>Sunday School
Chronicle</i>, <i>Record</i>, and others nearly in full, and was
read as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it is not in my power to open out a painful subject
in the flowery language of fiction, romance, and imagery, in
musical sounds of the highest pitch of refinement, culture, and
sentiment, I purpose following out very briefly the same course
on the present occasion as I adopted on the three times I have
had the honour to address the Social Science Congress with
reference to the brick-yard and canal-boat children&mdash;viz.,
that of attempting to place a few serious, hard, broad dark facts
in a plain, practical, common-sense view, so as to permeate your
nature till they have reached your hearts and consciences, and
compelled you to extend the hand of sympathy and help to rescue
my young clients from the dreadful and perilous condition into
which they have fallen through long years of neglect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Owing to a superstitious regard and dislike the Gipsies
had towards the Census, and their endeavours to evade being
taken, no correct number has been arrived at; and it is only by
guess work and conjecture we can form any idea of the number of
Gipsies there are in this country.&nbsp; The Census puts the
number at between 4,000 and 5,000.&nbsp; A gentleman who has
lived and moved among them many years writes me to say that there
cannot be less than 2,000 in the neighbourhood of London, whose
Paradises are in the neighbourhood of Wormwood Scrubs, Notting
Hill Pottery, New Found Out, Kensal Green, Battersea, Dulwich
Common, Lordship Lane, Mitcham Common, Barnes Common, Epping
Forest, Cherry Island, and like places.&nbsp; A gentleman told me
some time since that he gave a tea to over 150 Gipsies residing
in the neighbourhood of Kensal Green.&nbsp; A Gipsy woman who has
moved about all her life says she knows about 300 families <!--
page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>in ten of the Midland counties.&nbsp; Another Gipsy, in
a different part of England, tells me a similar story, and says
the same proportion will be borne out all over the country.&nbsp;
Of hawkers, auctioneers, showmen, and others who live in caravans
with their families, there would be, at a rough calculation, not
less than 3,000 children; taking these things along with others,
and the number given in the Census, it may be fairly assumed that
I am under the mark when I state that there are not less than
4,000 Gipsy men and women, and 15,000 to 20,000 Gipsy and other
children moving about the country outside the educational laws
and the pale of civilisation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some few Gipsies who have arrived at what they consider
the highest state of a respectable and civilised life, reside in
houses which, in 99 cases out of 100, are in the lowest and most
degraded part of the towns, among the scum and offscouring of all
nations, and like locusts they leave a blight behind them
wherever they have been.&nbsp; Others have their tents and vans,
and there are many others who I have tents only.&nbsp; A tent as
a rule is about 7ft. 6in. wide, 16ft. long, and 4ft. 6in. high at
the top.&nbsp; They are covered with pieces of old cloth,
sacking, &amp;c., to keep the rain and snow out; the opening to
allow the Gipsies to go in and out of their tent is covered with
a kind of coverlet.&nbsp; The fire by which they cook their meals
is placed in a kind of tin bucket pierced with holes, and stands
on the damp ground.&nbsp; Some of the smoke or sulphur arising
from the sticks or coke finds its way through an opening at the
top of the tent about 2ft. in diameter.&nbsp; The other part of
the smoke helps to keep their faces and hands the proper Gipsy
colour.&nbsp; Their beds consist of a layer of straw upon the
damp ground, covered with a sack or sheet, as the case may
be.&nbsp; An old soapbox or tea-chest serves as a chest of
drawers, drawing-room table, and clothes-box.&nbsp; In these
places children are born, live, and die; men, women, grown-up
sons and daughters, lie huddled together in such a state as would
shock the <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>modesty of South African savages, to
whom we send missionaries to show them the blessings of
Christianity.&nbsp; As in other cases where idleness and filth
abounds, what little washing they do is generally done on the
Saturday afternoons; but this is a business they do not indulge
in too often.&nbsp; They are not overdone with cooking utensils,
and the knives and forks they principally use are of the kind
Adam used, and sensitive when applied to hot water.&nbsp; They
take their meals and do their washing squatting upon the ground
like tailors and Zulus.&nbsp; Lying, begging, thieving, cheating,
and every other abominable, low, cunning craft that ignorance and
idleness can devise, they practise.&nbsp; In some instances these
things are carried out to such a pitch as to render them more
like imbeciles than human beings endowed with reason.&nbsp;
Chair-mending, tinkering, and hawking are in many instances used
only as a &lsquo;blind;&rsquo; while the women and children go
about the country begging and fortune-telling, bringing to their
heathenish tents sufficient to keep the family.&nbsp; The poor
women are the slaves and tools for the whole family, and can be
seen very often with a child upon their backs, another in their
arms, and a heavily-laden basket by their side.&nbsp; Upon the
shoulders of the women rests the responsibility of providing for
the herds of ditch-dwelling heathens.&nbsp; Many of the women
enjoy their short pipes quite as much as the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judging from the conversations I have had with the
Gipsies in various parts of the country, not more than half
living as men and wives are married.&nbsp; No form or ceremony
has been gone through, not even &lsquo;jumping the
broomstick,&rsquo; as has been reported of them; and taking the
words of a respectable Gipsy woman, &lsquo;they go together, take
each other&rsquo;s words, and there is an end of it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I am also assured by Levi Boswell, a real respectable Gipsy, and
a Mrs. Eastwood, a Christian woman and a Gipsy, who preaches
occasionally, that not half the Gipsies who are living as men and
wives are married.&nbsp; When once a Gipsy woman has <!-- page
99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>been
ill-used, she becomes fearful, and as one said to me a few days
since, &lsquo;we are either like devils or like
lambs.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the case of some of the adult Gipsies
living on the outskirts of London an improvement has taken
place.&nbsp; There is some good among them as with others.&nbsp;
A Gipsy in Wiltshire has built himself a house at the cost of
&pound;600.&nbsp; Considerable difficulty is experienced
sometimes in finding them out, as many of the women go by two
names; but in vain do I look for any improvement among the
children.&nbsp; Owing to the act relating to pedlars and hawkers
prohibiting the granting of licences for hawking to the youths of
both sexes under seventeen, and the Education Acts not being
sufficiently strong to lay hold of their dirty, idle, travelling
tribes to educate them&mdash;except in rare cases&mdash;they are
allowed to skulk about in ignorance and evil training, without
being taught how to get an honest living.&nbsp; No ray of hope
enters their breast, their highest ambition is to live and loll
about so long as the food comes, no matter by whom or how it
comes so that they get it.&nbsp; In many instances they live like
pigs, and die like dogs.&nbsp; The real old-fashioned Gipsy has
become more lewd and demoralised&mdash;if such a thing could
be&mdash;by allowing his sons and daughters to mix up with the
scamps, vagabonds, &lsquo;rodneys,&rsquo; and gaol birds, who now
and then take their flight from the &lsquo;stone cup&rsquo; and
settle among them as they are camping on the ditch banks; the
consequence is our lanes are being infested with a lot of dirty
ignorant Gipsies, who, with their tribes of squalid children,
have been encouraged by servant girls and farmers&mdash;by
supplying their wants with eggs, bacon, milk, potatoes, the men
helping themselves to game&mdash;to locate in the neighbourhood
until they have received the tip from the farmer to pass on to
his neighbours.&nbsp; Children born under such circumstances,
unless taken hold of by the State, will turn out to be a class of
most dangerous characters.&nbsp; Very much, up to the present,
the wants of the women and children have been supplied through
gulling the large-hearted and liberal-minded they <!-- page
100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>have been brought in contact with, and the result has
been that but few of the real Gipsies have found their way into
gaols.&nbsp; This is a redeeming feature in their character;
probably their offences may have been winked at by the farmers
and others who do not like the idea of having their stacks fired
and property destroyed, and have given the Gipsies a wide
berth.&nbsp; Gipsies, as a rule, have very large families,
generally between eight and sixteen children are born in their
tents.&nbsp; Owing to their exposure to the damp and cold ground
they suffer much from chest and throat complaints.&nbsp; Large
numbers of the children die young before they are
&lsquo;broken&rsquo; in.&rsquo;&nbsp; And it is a &lsquo;breaking
in&rsquo; in a tremendous sense, fraught with fearful
consequences.&nbsp; With regard to their education, the following
cases, selected from different parts of the country, may be
fairly taken as representative of the entire Gipsy
community.&nbsp; Boswell, a respectable Gipsy, says he has had
nine sons and daughters (six of whom are alive), and nineteen
grandchildren, and none of them can read or write; and he also
thinks that about half the Gipsy men and women living as husbands
and wives are unmarried.&nbsp; Mrs. Simpson, a Gipsy woman and a
Christian, says she has six sons and daughters and sixteen
grandchildren, and only two can read and write a little.&nbsp;
Mrs. Eastwood says she has nine brothers and sisters.&nbsp; Mr.
Eastwood, a Christian and a Gipsy, has eight brothers and
sisters, many among them have large families, making a total of
adults and children of about fifty of all ages, and there is
scarcely one among them who can tell a letter or read a sentence;
in addition to this number they have between them from 130 to 150
first and second cousins, among whom there are not more than two
who can read or write, and that but very little indeed, and Mr.
Eastwood thinks this proportion will apply to other
Gipsies.&nbsp; Mrs. Trayleer has six brothers and sisters, all
Gipsies, and not one can read or write.&nbsp; A Gipsy woman,
whose head-quarters are near Ashby-de-la-Zouch, has fifteen
brothers and sisters, some <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>of whom
have large families.&nbsp; She herself has fifteen sons and
daughters alive, some of whom are married.&nbsp; But of the whole
of these brothers and sisters, nieces, nephews, grandchildren,
&amp;c., numbering not less than 100 of all ages, not more than
three or four can read or write, and they who can but very
imperfectly.&nbsp; Mrs. Matthews has a family of seven children,
nearly all grown-up, and not one out of the whole of these can
read or write; thus it will be seen that I shall be under the
mark when I state that not five per cent. of the Gipsies,
&amp;c., travelling about the country in tents and vans can
either read or write; and I have not found one Gipsy but what
thinks it would be a good thing if their tents and vans were
registered, and the children compelled to go to school&mdash;in
fact, many of them are anxious for such a thing to be brought
about.&nbsp; In the case of the brick-yard and canal-boat
children, they were over-worked as well as ignorant.&nbsp; In the
case of the Gipsy children, these children and roadside arabs,
for the want of education, ambition, animation, and push, are
indulging in practices that are fast working their own
destruction and those they are brought into contact with, and a
great deal of this may lay at the door of flattery, twaddle,
petting, and fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plan I would adopt to remedy this sad state of
things is to apply the principles of the Canal Boats Act of 1877
to all movable habitations&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, I would have all
tents, shows, caravans, auctioneers&rsquo; vans, and like places
used as dwellings registered and numbered, and under proper
sanitary arrangements and supervision of the sanitary inspectors
and School Board officers in every town and village.&nbsp; With
regard to the education of the children when once the tent or van
is registered and numbered, the children, whether travelling as
Gipsies, auctioneers, &amp;c., are mostly idle during the day;
consequently, a book similar to the half-time book, in which
their names and attendance at school could be entered, they could
take from place to place as they travel about, and it could be
endorsed by the schoolmaster <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>showing
that the child was attending school.&nbsp; The education obtained
in this way would not be of the highest order; but through the
kindness of the schoolmaster&mdash;for which extra trouble he
should be compensated, as he ought to be under the Canal Boats
Act&mdash;and the vigilance of the School Board visitor, a plain,
practical, and sound education could be imparted to, and obtained
by, these poor little Gipsy children and roadside arabs, who, if
we do our duty, will be qualified to fill the places of those of
our best artisans who are leaving the country to seek their
fortunes abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following is a leading article in the <i>Birmingham Daily
Mail</i>, October 8th:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. George Smith, whose
exertions on behalf of the canal population and the children
employed in brick-yards have been accompanied with so much
success, is now turning his attention to the education of the
Gipsies.&nbsp; He read a paper on this subject at the Social
Science Congress, yesterday, suggesting that the same plan of
registration which had proved advantageous in the case of the
canal-boatmen and their families should be adopted for the more
nomadic class who roam from place to place, with no settled home
and no local habitation.&nbsp; The Gipsies are a strange race,
with a romantic history, and their vagabond life is surrounded
with enough of the mysterious to give them at all times a special
and curious interest.&nbsp; In the days of our infancy we are
frightened with tales of their child-thieving propensities, and
even when years and reason have asserted their influence we are
apt to regard with a survival of our childish awe the wandering
&lsquo;diviners and wicked heathens&rsquo; who roam about the
country, living in a mysterious aloofness from their
fellow-men.&nbsp; Scores of theories have been propounded as to
the origin of the Gipsy race, whence they sprang, and how they
came to be so largely scattered over three of the four quarters
of the globe.&nbsp; Opinion, following in the wake of the learned
Rudiger, has finally settled down to the view that they came <!--
page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>from India, but whether they are the Tshandalas
referred to in the laws of Menou, or kinsmen of the Bazeegars of
Calcutta, or are descended from the robbers of the Indus, or are
identical with the Nuts and Djatts of Northern India, has not
been ascertained with any degree of certainty.&nbsp; The
Gyptologists are not yet agreed upon the ancestry of this ancient
but obscure race, and possibly they never will be.&nbsp; We know,
however, that the Gipsies have wandered up and down Europe since
the eleventh century, if not from a still earlier period, and
that they have preserved their Bohemian characteristics, their
language&mdash;which is a sort of daughter of the old
Sanscrit&mdash;their traditions, and the mysteries of their
religion during a long career of restless movement and frequent
persecution.&nbsp; And they have kept, too, their indolent, and
not too creditable habits.&nbsp; Early in the twelfth century an
Austrian monk described them as &lsquo;Ishmaelites and braziers,
who go peddling through the wide world, having neither house, nor
home, cheating the people with their tricks, and deceiving
mankind, but not openly.&rsquo;&nbsp; That description would hold
good at the present day.&nbsp; The Gipsies are still a lazy,
thieving set of rogues, who get their living by robbing
hen-roosts, telling fortunes, and &lsquo;snapping up unconsidered
trifles&rsquo; like Autolycus of old.&nbsp; Pilfering, varied
with a rude sort of magic, and the swindling arts of divination
and chiromancy for the special behoof of credulous servant-girls,
are the stock-in-trade of the modern Zingaris.&nbsp; Without
education, and without industry, they transmit their vagrant
habits to generation after generation, and perpetuate all the
vices of a lawless and nomadic life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very easy to give a romantic and even a
sentimental colouring to the wandering Romany.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;greenwood home,&rsquo; with its freedom from all the
restraints of a conventional state of society, is not without its
attractive side&mdash;in books and in ballads.&nbsp; Minor poets
have told us that &lsquo;the Gipsy&rsquo;s life is a joyous
life,&rsquo; and plays and operas have been <!-- page 104--><a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>written to
illustrate the superiority of vagabondage over
civilisation.&nbsp; But the pretty Gitana of the stage is
altogether a different sort of being from the brown-faced,
elf-locked, and tawdrily dressed female who haunts back entries
with the ostensible object of selling clothes-pegs, but with the
real motive of picking up whatever may be lying in her way.&nbsp;
There is but small chance of Bohemian Girls finding themselves in
drawing-rooms nowadays.&nbsp; The last experiment of the kind was
made by the writer of a charming book on the Gipsies, who was so
fascinated by one of their number that he married her; but the
wild, restless spirit was untameable, and the divorce court
proved that the supposed precept of fidelity, which is said to
guide the conduct of Gipsy wives, is not without its
exceptions.&nbsp; The Gipsies have nothing in common with our
conventional ways and habits, and whether it is possible ever to
remove the barrier that separates them from civilisation is a
question which only experiment can satisfactorily answer.&nbsp;
Mr. Smith&rsquo;s scheme is not the first, by many, that has been
made to improve the conditions of Gipsy life.&nbsp; Nearly half a
century ago the Rev. Mr. Crabb, of Southampton, formed a society
with the object of amalgamating the Gipsies with the general
population, but the scheme was comparatively futile.&nbsp; Still,
past failure is no reason why a new attempt should not be
made.&nbsp; Mr. Smith says there cannot be less than 4,000 Gipsy
men and women, and from 15,000 to 20,000 Gipsy children moving
about the country, outside the educational laws and the pale of
civilisation, and not five per cent. of them can either read or
write.&nbsp; Their mode of life is such as &lsquo;would shock the
modesty of South African savages,&rsquo; for men, women, and
grown-up sons and daughters lie huddled together, and in many
cases they &lsquo;live like pigs and die like dogs.&rsquo;&nbsp;
There is certainly room enough here for education, and education
is the only thing that is likely to have any practical
results.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is proposed that the principles of the Canal Boats
<!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>Act shall be applied to all movable habitations; that
is, that all tents, shows, caravans, auctioneers&rsquo; vans, and
like places used as dwellings, shall be registered and numbered,
and put under proper sanitary supervision.&nbsp; Mr. Smith points
out that when once a tent or van had been registered and
numbered, it could be furnished with a book similar to a
half-time book, in which the names of the children having first
been entered, the attendances at school could be endorsed by the
schoolmaster&mdash;for which extra trouble he should be
compensated&mdash;as the children travelled about from place to
place.&nbsp; By this means something tangible would be done to
prevent the roadside waifs from growing up in the ignorance which
is the parent of idleness.&nbsp; Why should these ten or fifteen
thousand little nomads be allowed to remain in the neglected
condition which has characterised their strange race for
centuries?&nbsp; It is time that the spell was broken.&nbsp;
There are no traditions of Gipsy life worth perpetuating; there
is no sentimental halo around its history which it would be cruel
to dispel.&nbsp; In past ages the Gipsies have been subjected to
harsh laws and barbarous edicts; it remains for our more
enlightened times to deal with them on a humaner plan.&nbsp; It
is only by the expanding influence of education that the little
minds of their children can gain a necessary experience of the
utility and dignity of honest labour.&nbsp; When they have
received some measure of instruction they will be fitter to
emerge from the aimless and vagabond life of their forefathers,
and break away from the squalor and precarious existence which
has held so many generations of them in thrall.&nbsp; Mr.
Smith&rsquo;s idea is worthy the attention of legislators.&nbsp;
It does not look so grand on paper, we admit, but it is a nobler
thing to educate the young barbarian at home than to make war
upon the unoffending barbarian abroad.&nbsp; The instincts and
habits which have been transmitted from father to son for
hundreds of years are not, of course, to be eradicated in a day,
or even in a generation; but the time will, perhaps, eventually
<!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>come when the Gipsies will cease to exist as a separate
and distinct people, and become absorbed into the general
population of the country.&nbsp; Whether that absorption takes
place sooner or later, nothing can be lost by conferring on the
young &lsquo;Arabs&rsquo; of the tents the rudiments of an
education which will hereafter be helpful to them if they are
desirous of abandoning their squalor and indolence, and of
earning an industrious livelihood.&nbsp; Their dread of fixed and
continuous occupation may die out in time, and closer intimacy
with the conditions of industrial life may teach them that
civilisation has some compensations to offer for the sacrifice of
their roaming propensities, and for taking away from them their
&lsquo;free mountains, their plains and woods, the sun, the
stars, and the winds&rsquo; which are the companions of their
free and unfettered, but wasted and purposeless lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Weekly Dispatch</i>, in a leading article, October
13th, says:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, has an
eye for the nomads of the country.&nbsp; His name must already be
unfavourably known throughout most of the canal barges of the
United Kingdom.&nbsp; If he is not the Croquemitaine of every
floating nursery journeying inland from the metropolis he ought
to be, for it was mainly he who thrust a half-time book into the
hands of the bargee and compelled him, by the Canal Boats Act of
1877, to soap his infants&rsquo; faces and put primers in their
way.&nbsp; With Smith of Coalville, therefore, it may be expected
that each juvenile of the wharves and locks now associates his
most unhappy moments.&nbsp; The half-time book of the act comes
between him and the blessed state of his previous
ignorance.&nbsp; Registered and numbered, supervised and
inspected, he has been put on the road to know things that must
necessarily disillusionise him of the black enchantments of life
on the water highway.&nbsp; It is allowable to hope, however,
that having recovered from the first discomforts of civilising
soap and primers, he will yet live to appreciate Mr.
Smith&rsquo;s name as one associated <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>with kindly
intent and generous aspirations in his behalf.&nbsp; A generation
of bargemen who had a less uncompromising vocabulary of oaths,
who could beguile some of the tedium of their voyaging with
reading, and who in other important respects showed the
influences of half-time, would be a smiling reward of
philanthropy and an important addition to our civilisation.&nbsp;
That Mr. Smith anticipates some such reward is evident from the
eagerness with which he has been pushing the principle in another
quarter.&nbsp; At the Social Science Congress he has just
propounded a scheme of educational annexation for Gipsy children
similar in every respect to that applied to the occupants of the
canal-boats.&nbsp; That is, he would have every tent and van
numbered and furnished with a half-time book, and he would ordain
it as the duty of School Board visitors to see that the Gipsies
render their children amenable to the terms of the act to the
extent of their wandering ability, under threat of the usual
penalties.&nbsp; The prospect which he foresees from such
treatment is that a body of wanderers numbering not much below
20,000 will be rescued from a position which, he says, would at
present shock South African savages, and will thus be brought in
to honest industry and &lsquo;qualified to fill the places of our
best artisans, who are leaving the country to seek their fortunes
abroad.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is impossible not to wish Mr.
Smith&rsquo;s scheme well, especially as he contends that the
Gipsies themselves are not averse to having their children
educated; but it is equally impossible to be sanguine as to
results.&nbsp; The true Gipsy, who is not to be confounded with
the desultory hawker of English origin, has many arteries of
untameable blood within him.&nbsp; He has never as yet shown the
slightest concern about the English phases of civilisation which
Mr. Smith would like to press upon his notice.&nbsp; Such ideas
as those of God, immortality, and marriage are as unknown to him
as the commonest distinction between mine and thine.&nbsp; He is
a well-looking artistic vagabond, to whom a half-time book and a
penalty will in all probability <!-- page 108--><a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>be no
better than a standing joke to be cracked with impunity at the
expense of the rural School Boards.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>The <i>Sportsman</i> of October 16th, 1879, has the following
notice:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, whose
philanthropic efforts on behalf of &lsquo;our canal-boat
population&rsquo; are well known, has lately turned his attention
to the wandering Gipsy tribes who infest the roadside, with the
view to procuring at least a modicum of education for their
children.&nbsp; He says that the Gipsies are lamentably ignorant,
few of them being able even to write their names.&nbsp; By
certain proceedings which took place at Christchurch Police-court
on Tuesday, it would almost seem that some of the dark-faced
wanderers already are educated a little too much.&nbsp; At all
events, they occasionally manifest an ability to &lsquo;take a
stave&rsquo; out of the rest of the community.&nbsp; At the court
in question a Gipsy woman named Emma Barney was brought to task
for &lsquo;imposing by subtle craft to extort money&rsquo; from a
Bournemouth shopkeeper named Richard Oliver.&nbsp; It seems that
Oliver is troubled with pimples on his face, and that Emma
Barney&mdash;not an inappropriate name, by the way&mdash;said she
could cure these by means of a certain herb, the name of which
she would divulge &lsquo;for a consideration.&rsquo;&nbsp; Before
doing so, however, she required Richard&rsquo;s coat and
waistcoat, and some silver to &lsquo;steam in hot water,&rsquo;
after which the name of the herb would be given&mdash;on the
following day.&nbsp; It is needless to say that the coat,
waistcoat, and silver did not return to the Oliver home, and that
the pimples did not depart from the Oliver face.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Gipsy&rsquo;s home&rsquo; for the next two months will be
in the county gaol.&nbsp; It is a curious reflection, however,
that such strange credulity as that displayed by the Bournemouth
shopkeeper in this case can be found in the present year of
grace, with its gigantic machinery for educating the
masses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following leading article, taken from the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i>, under date October 17th of last year, will show
that crime is far from abating among the classes of the Gipsy
<!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>fraternity:&mdash;&ldquo;The melancholy truth that
there exists a &lsquo;breed&rsquo; of criminals in all societies
was well illustrated at Exeter this week.&nbsp; Sir John
Duckworth, as Chairman of the Devon Quarter Sessions, in charging
the grand jury, had to tell them that the calendar was very
heavy, the heaviest, in fact, known for many years.&nbsp; There
were forty-five prisoners for trial, whereas the average number
is twenty-five, taking the last five years.&nbsp; Sir John could
assign no particular reason for such a lamentable increase,
though he supposed the prevailing depression of trade might have
had something to do with it.&nbsp; But he pointed out a very
notable fact indeed, which sprang from an examination of the gaol
delivery, and this was that out of the forty-five prisoners
twenty had been previously convicted.&nbsp; Such a percentage
goes far to prove that the criminal propensity is innate, and to
a certain degree ineradicable by punishments; and this only
enhances the immense importance of national education, by which
alone society can hope to conquer the predatory tendency in
certain baser blood, and to supply it with the means and the
instincts of industry.&nbsp; In justice, however, to the existing
generation of criminals, we ought also to remember that such
serious figures further prove the difficulty encountered by
released prisoners in living honestly.&nbsp; A rat will not steal
where traps are set if it can only find food in the open, and
some of these twice-captured vermin of our community might tell a
piteous tale of the obstacles that lie in the way of
honesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Weekly Times</i>, under date October 26th, 1879, has
the following article upon the Gipsies near London.&nbsp; The
locality described is not one hundred miles from Mary&rsquo;s
Place and Notting Hill Potteries.&nbsp; The writer goes on to say
that &ldquo;There are at the present time upwards of two thousand
people&mdash;men, women, and children, members of the Gipsy
tribe&mdash;camped in the outlying districts of London.&nbsp;
They are settled upon waste places of every kind.&nbsp; Bits of
ground that will ere long be occupied by houses, waste corners
that <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>seem to be of no good for anything,
yards belonging to public-houses, or pieces of
&lsquo;common&rsquo; over which no authority claims any rights;
or if there are rights, the authority is too obscure to interfere
with such poor settlers as Gipsies, who will move away again
before an authoritative opinion can be pronounced upon any
question affecting them.&nbsp; The Gipsies, in the winter,
certainly cause very few inconveniences in such places as the
metropolis.&nbsp; They do not cause rents to rise.&nbsp; They are
satisfied to put up their tent where a Londoner would only
accommodate his pig or his dog, and they certainly do not affect
the balance of labour, few of them being ever guilty of robbing a
man of an honest day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; Yet, with all their
failings, the Gipsies have always found friends ready to take
their part in times of trouble, and crave a sufferance on account
of their hard lot, and the scanty measure with which the good
things of this life have been, and still are, meted out to
them.&nbsp; Constrained by an irresistible force to keep ever
moving, they fulfil the fate imposed upon them with a degree of
cheerfulness which no other class of people would exhibit.&nbsp;
As the approach of winter reduces outdoor pursuits to the fewest
possible number, the farm labourer finds it difficult to employ
the whole of his time profitably, and those who only follow an
outdoor life for the pleasures it yields naturally gravitate
towards the shelter of large towns in which to spend the winter
months of every year.&nbsp; So when the cold winds begin to blow,
and the leaves are falling, the Gipsies come to town, and settle
upon the odd nooks and corners, and fill up the unused yards, and
eat and drink, and bring up children, in the very places where
their fathers and grandfathers have done the same before
them.&nbsp; The young men get a day&rsquo;s work where they can;
the young women hawk wool mats, laces, or other women&rsquo;s
vanities; while the more skilful go round with rope mats, and
every form of chair or stool that can be made of rushes and
canes.&nbsp; The old folks do a little grinding of knives, or
tinker pots and pans; and, if a fine <!-- page 111--><a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>day or a
pleasure fair calls forth all the useful mouths and hands from
their tents and caravans, the babies will take care of themselves
in the straw which makes the pony&rsquo;s bed until some member
of the camp returns home in the evening.&nbsp; So the winter
months pass away, and in the spring, when the cuckoo begins to
call, these restless-footed people, whose origin no man is
acquainted with, go forth again, and in the lanes and woods, or
on the commons of the country, pass their summer, earning a
precarious subsistance&mdash;honestly if they can&mdash;content
with hard food and poor clothes, so that they may feel the free
air of heaven blowing about them night and day, while the sun
paints their cheeks the colour of the ancient Egyptians.&nbsp;
Our Gipsies have always been a favourite study with ethnological
folk; poets have sung their wild, free life, and painters have
taken them as types of the happy, if the careless; while
philanthropists have occasionally gone amongst them, and told
pitiful tales of their degradation, ignorance, and misery.&nbsp;
It was not from any feeling of romance or pity that we were
induced the other day to accept an invitation from Mr. George
Smith, of Coalville, to spend a few hours amongst some of these
people.&nbsp; Mr. George Smith&rsquo;s life has been devoted to
the amelioration of the condition of many very poor and almost
entirely neglected classes of the community, and it was pleasant
to have the opportunity of going with such a simple-hearted hero
amongst those in whom he takes a deep interest.&nbsp; Having
devoted many years of his life to the poor brick-yard children,
and afterwards to the children labouring in canal-boats, he has
found one more class still left outside every Act of Parliament,
and beyond every chance of being helped in the right way to earn
an honest living and become industrious members of society.&nbsp;
These are the Gipsies and their children, who have been let alone
so severely by all so-called right-thinking men and women that
there is great danger of their becoming a sore evil in our
midst.&nbsp; Unable to read or write&mdash;their powers of
thought <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>thereby cramped&mdash;with no one to
look after them, separated from the people in whose midst they
live, there can be little wonder that they should grow up with
certain loose notions about right and wrong, and a manner of life
the reverse of that which prevails amongst Christian people; but,
now that Mr. George Smith has got his eyes and his heart fixed
upon them, there will surely be something done which, in the near
future, will redeem these people from many of the disadvantages
under which they labour, and add to the body corporate a tribe
possessed of many amiable characteristics.&nbsp; Mr. Smith never
takes up more than one thing at a time, and upon the
accomplishment of it he concentrates all his energies.&nbsp; This
attribute is the one which has enabled him to carry to successful
conclusions the acts for the relief of the brick-yard and the
canal-boat children; but while he is about a work he becomes
thoroughly possessed by his subject, and the most important event
that may happen for the country, or for the world, loses all
value in his eyes unless it bears directly upon the
accomplishment of the object in hand.&nbsp; Thus it happened
that, from the time we sallied out together in search of a Gipsy
camp, until the moment we parted at night, Mr. Smith thought of
nothing, spoke of nothing, remembered nothing, saw nothing, but
what had some relation to the Gipsies and their mode of
life.&nbsp; The Zulus were to be pitied because theirs was a sort
of Gipsy life; and the Gipsies&rsquo; tents were nothing more
than kraals.&nbsp; All his stories were of what Gipsies he had
met, and what they had said; and even our fellow-travellers in
the train were only noticeable because they looked like some
Gipsy man or woman whom he had met elsewhere.&nbsp; We had a
short ride by rail, and a tramp through a densely-populated
district, and then we came to the camping-ground we wanted.&nbsp;
It was a spacious yard, entered through a gate, and surrounded
with houses, whose back yards formed the enclosure.&nbsp; There
were three caravans and three kraals erected there, and as it was
Sunday afternoon nearly all the inhabitants <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>were at
home.&nbsp; Those who were absent were a few children able to go
to Sunday-school, whither they went of their own free will and
with the approval of their parents.&nbsp; The kraals were not all
constructed on the same pattern&mdash;two were circular in form
and the third was square.&nbsp; This was on the right hand at
entering, and had at one time been a tumble-down shelter for a
calf, who had many years before gone the way of all
beef&mdash;into a butcher&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; There were tiles on
the low roof&mdash;in places&mdash;but plenty of openings were
left for the rain to come in, and for the smoke from the fire in
the bucket to find a way out if it chose.&nbsp; The floor was
common earth, and very uneven in places.&nbsp; Alice, the
mistress of this abode, was a woman over fifty, with a face the
colour of leather, and vigour enough to do any amount of
work.&nbsp; As we entered, she told Mr. Smith a piteous tale of
the loss of her spectacles, without which she solemnly declared
she could not read a line.&nbsp; She left the spectacles one day
when she was going &lsquo;hopping,&rsquo; hidden under a tile
above her head, and when she returned the case was there, but the
spectacles were gone.&nbsp; She carried her licence to hawk in
her spectacle-case, until the time came when she could happily
beg the gift of a pair of new ones.&nbsp; Her husband, a
white-haired old man, with a look of innocent wonder in his face,
sat on a lump of wood, warming his hands over the fire.&nbsp; He
said little&mdash;his wife scarcely allowing an opportunity for
any one else to speak&mdash;but seemed to consider that he was a
fortunate man in having such a remarkable wife.&nbsp; There was a
handsome young woman sitting in the only chair in the place,
daughter of the old couple; and her brother lay extended on a bed
made of indescribable things in one portion of the cabin, where
the tiles in the roof showed no openings to the sky.&nbsp; His
wife, a thoroughbred Gipsy, sat nursing a baby&mdash;their
first-born&mdash;on the edge of the bed.&nbsp; The wood walls
were covered with old clothes, sacking, and a variety of odd
things, fastened in their places by wooden skewers, and adorned
with a few pots and pans <!-- page 114--><a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>used in
cooking.&nbsp; Here, for six or seven winters, this family had
resided, defying alike the frosts and snows and rains of the most
severe winters.&nbsp; Nor could they be made to admit that a
cottage would be more comfortable; that hut had served them well
enough so many years, and would be good enough as long as they
lived.&nbsp; Besides, said Alice, the rent was a consideration,
and the whole yard only cost 2s. a week.&nbsp; This woman was the
mother of eighteen children, of whom eleven were living.&nbsp;
Drawn up close by was a caravan, in the occupation at the time of
two young women, thorough Gipsies in face and tongue, who chaffed
us as to the object of our visit, and begged hard for some kind
of remembrance to be left with them.&nbsp; But we did not accept
their invitation to walk up, but passed down the yard, by heaps
of manure and refuse of all kinds, by another kraal, where a
bucket containing coal was burning, and a young man lay stretched
on a dirty mattress, and a little bantam kept watch beside him,
to the steps of another caravan, where, from the sounds we heard,
high jinks were going on with some children.&nbsp; At the sound
of a tap on the door there was an instant hush, and then a girl
of nineteen, who had a baby in her arms, asked us to come
in.&nbsp; We looked up in amazement; the girl&rsquo;s face
appeared like an apparition&mdash;so fair, so beautiful, so like
some face we had seen elsewhere, that we were confused and
puzzled.&nbsp; In a moment the mystery was solved; we had seen
that face before in several of the choicest canvases that have
hung in recent years upon the walls of the Academy; we had met
with the fairest Gipsy model that ever stood before the students
of the Academy, the favourite alike of the young artist and the
head of his profession.&nbsp; It can only fall to the lot of a
few to see Annie, the Gipsy model; but the curious may look upon
her counterpart, only of heroic size, in Clytie, at the British
Museum.&nbsp; Annie has a face of exquisite Grecian form, and a
hand so delicate that it has been painted more than once in the
&lsquo;portrait of a titled lady.&rsquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 115--><a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>When she
was a very little girl, she told us, hawking laces in a basket
one day, a gentleman met her at the West-end who was a painter,
and from that day to the present Annie has earned a
living&mdash;and at times of great distress maintained all the
family&mdash;by the fees she received as a model.&nbsp; Her
mother had had nine children, of whom eight were living; and
three of the family are constantly employed as models.&nbsp;
Annie is one, the young fellow who was watched over by the bantam
was another, and a boy of four was the third.&nbsp; The father is
of pure Gipsy blood, but the mother is an Oxfordshire woman, and
neither of them possess any striking characteristic in their
faces; yet all their girls are singularly beautiful, and their
sons handsome fellows.&nbsp; They have got a reputation for
beauty now, and ladies have, but without success, tried to
negotiate for the possession of the youngest.&nbsp; Never before
had we seen such fair faces, such dainty limbs, such exquisite
eyes, as were possessed by the Gipsy occupants of that
caravan.&nbsp; Annie was as modest and gentle-voiced and mannered
as she was beautiful; and there came a flush of trouble over her
fair face as she told us that not being able to read or write had
&lsquo;been against&rsquo; her all her life.&nbsp; There was more
refinement about Annie and her mother than we had discovered
amongst others with whom we had conversed.&nbsp; Thus, Annie,
speaking of her grandfather, laid great emphasis on the assertion
that he was a fine man.&nbsp; He lived to be 104, she said, and
walked as upright as a young man to his death.&nbsp; He went
about crying &lsquo;chairs to mend,&rsquo; in that very locality,
up to within a short time of his death, and all the old ladies
employed him because he was so handsome.&nbsp; She was playing
with a baby girl as she talked with us, and the child fixed her
black eyes upon her sister&rsquo;s face, and crooned with baby
pleasure.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is baby&rsquo;s name,&rsquo; we
asked?&nbsp; &lsquo;Comfort,&rsquo; replied Annie.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We were hopping one year&rsquo; said the mother,
&lsquo;and there was a young woman in the party I took to very
much, and her name was Comfort.&nbsp; Coming away <!-- page
116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>from the hop grounds, the caravans had to cross a
river, and while we were in the water one day the river suddenly
rose, the caravans were upset, and eleven were drowned, Comfort
amongst the number.&nbsp; So I christened baby after her in
remembrance.&rsquo;&nbsp; All the family were neatly dressed, and
once, when Annie opened the cupboard door for an instant, we
caught sight of a dish of small currant puddings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A visit to a batch of Gipsy wigwams, Wardlow Street, Garrett
Lane, Wandsworth, induced me to send the following letter to the
London and country daily papers, and it appeared in the <i>Daily
Chronicle</i> and <i>Daily News</i>, November 20th, as
under:&mdash;&ldquo;The following touching incident may slightly
show the thorough heartfelt desire there is&mdash;but lacking the
power&mdash;among the Gipsies to be partakers of some of the
sanitary and educational advantages the Gorgios or Gentiles are
the recipients of.&nbsp; A few days since I wended my way to a
large number of Gipsies located in tents, huts, and vans near
Wandsworth Common, to behold the pitiable spectacle of some sixty
half-naked, poor Gipsy children, and thirty Gipsy men and women,
living in a state of indescribable ignorance, dirt, filth, and
misery, mostly squatting upon the ground, making their beds upon
peg shavings and straw, and divested of the last tinge of
romantical nonsense, which is little better in this
case&mdash;used as a deal of it is&mdash;than paper pasted upon
the windows, to hide from public view the mass of human
corruption which has been festering in our midst for centuries,
breeding all kinds of sin and impurities, except in the eyes of
those who see beautiful colours and delights in the aroma of
stagnant pools and beauty in the sparkling hues of the gutter,
and revel in adding tints and pictures to the life and death of a
weasel, lending enchantment to the life of a vagabond, and admire
the non-intellectual development of beings many of whom are only
one step from that of animals, if I may judge from the amount of
good the 20,000 Gipsies have accomplished in the <!-- page
117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>world during the last three or four centuries.&nbsp;
Connected with this encampment not more than four or five of the
poor creatures could read a sentence or write a letter.&nbsp; In
creeping almost upon &lsquo;all-fours,&rsquo; into one of the
tents, I came across a real, antiquated, live, good kind of Gipsy
woman named Britannia Lee, who boasted that she was a Lee of the
fourth generation; and in sitting down upon a seat that brought
my knees upon a level with my chin, I entered into conversation
with the family about the objects of my inquiries&mdash;of which
they said they had heard all about&mdash;viz., to get all the
Gipsy tents, vans, and other movable habitations in the country
registered and under proper sanitary arrangements, and the
children compelled to attend school wherever they may be
temporarily located, and to receive an education which will in
some degree help to get these poor unfortunate people out of the
heartrending and desponding condition into which they have been
allowed to sink.&nbsp; Although Mrs. Lee was ill and poor, her
face beamed with gladness to find that I was trying in my humble
way to do the Gipsy children good; and in a kind of maternal
feeling she said she should be pleased to show her deep interest
in my work, and asked me if I would accept all the money she had
in the world, viz., one penny and two farthings?&nbsp; With much
persuasion and hesitation, and under fear of offending her, I
accepted them, which I purpose keeping as a token of a
woman&rsquo;s desire to do something towards improving her
&lsquo;kith and kin.&rsquo;&nbsp; She said that Providence would
see that she was no loser for the mite she had given to me.&nbsp;
He once sent her, in her extremity, a shilling in the middle of a
potato, which she found when cooking.&nbsp; With many expressions
of &lsquo;God bless you in your work among the children!&nbsp;
You will be rewarded some day for all your time, trouble, and
expense,&rsquo; we parted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The London correspondent of the <i>Croydon Chronicle</i>
writes as under, on November 22nd, touching a visit we both made
to a number of poor Gipsy children squatting <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>about upon
Mitcham Common.&nbsp; Among other things he says:&mdash;&ldquo;I
have had a day in your neighbourhood with George Smith, of
Coalville.&nbsp; He is visiting all the Gipsy grounds he can find
and reach, for the purpose of gaining information as to the
condition of the swarms of children who live in squalor and
ignorance under tents.&nbsp; He is of opinion that he will be
able to get them into schools, and do as much for them generally
as he has done for the brick-field and canal children; and I have
no doubt myself that he will succeed.&nbsp; Well, the other day
he asked me to have a run round with him, and we went to Mitcham
Common to see some of the families there.&nbsp; He told me that
one of the Gipsy women had been confined, and that she wanted him
to give the child a name.&nbsp; He did not know what to call it,
so we had to put our heads together and settle the matter.&nbsp;
After a great deal of careful deliberation he decided that when
we reached the common the child should be called
&lsquo;Deliverance.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have been told that this
sounds like the name of a new ironclad, and perhaps it would have
done as well for one as for the other.&nbsp; The tents were much
of a character&mdash;some kind of stitched-together rags thrown
over sticks.&nbsp; Our visit was made on a fine day, when it was
not particularly cold, and the first tent we came to had been
opened at the top.&nbsp; We looked over (these tents are only
about five feet high), and beheld six children, the eldest being
a girl of about eight or ten.&nbsp; The father was anywhere to
suit the imagination, and the mother was away hawking.&nbsp;
These children, sitting on the ground with a fire in the middle
of them, were making clothes-pegs.&nbsp; The process seemed
simple.&nbsp; The sticks are chopped into the necessary lengths
and put into a pan of hot water.&nbsp; This I suppose swells the
wood and loosens the bark.&nbsp; A child on the other side takes
out the sticks as they are done and bites off the bark with its
teeth.&nbsp; Then there is a boy who puts tin round them, and so
the work goes on.&nbsp; When the day is done they look for the
mother coming home from <!-- page 119--><a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>hawking
with anything she may have picked up.&nbsp; When they have
devoured such scraps and pickings as are brought, they lie down
where they have worked and as they are, and go to sleep.&nbsp; It
is a wonderful and mysterious arrangement of Providence that they
can sleep.&nbsp; They have only a rag between them and the
snow.&nbsp; A good wind would blow their homes over the
trees.&nbsp; I do not wish to make any particularly violent
remarks, but I should like some of the comfortable clergymen of
your neighbourhood, when they have done buying their toys and
presents for young friends at Christmas, to walk to Mitcham
Common and see how the children are there.&nbsp; They would then
find out what humbugs they are, and how it is they do the work of
the Master.&nbsp; One tent is very much like another.&nbsp; We
visited about half-a-dozen, and we then went to name the
child.&nbsp; We stayed in this tent for about ten minutes.&nbsp;
It was inhabited by two families, numbering in all about
twenty.&nbsp; I talked a little time with the woman lying on the
ground, and she uncovered the baby to show it to me.&nbsp; I do
not know whether it is a boy or a girl, but
&lsquo;Deliverance&rsquo; will do for either one or the
other.&nbsp; She asked me to write the name on a piece of paper,
and I did so.&nbsp; With a few words, as jolly as we could make
them, we crawled out, thanks and blessings following George
Smith, as they always do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leading article in the <i>Primitive Methodist</i>, November
27th:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, is
endeavouring to do a work for the children of Gipsies similar to
that he has done for the children employed in brick-yards and the
children of canal-boatmen&mdash;that is, bring them under some
sort of supervision, so that they may secure at least a small
share in the educational advantages of the country.&nbsp;
Recently he published an account of a visit to an encampment of
the Gipsies near Wandsworth Common, and it is evident that these
wanderers without any settled place of abode look on his efforts
with some considerable approval.&nbsp; The encampment was made up
of a number of tents, huts, and <!-- page 120--><a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>vans, and
contained some sixty half-naked poor Gipsy children and thirty
Gipsy men and women, living in an indescribable state of
ignorance, dirt, filth, and misery, mostly squatting upon the
ground, or otherwise making their beds upon peg shavings and
straw; and it turned out upon inquiry that not more than four of
these poor creatures could read a sentence or write a
letter.&nbsp; They are, however, not indisposed to be subject to
regulations that will contribute to their partial education, if
to nothing more.&nbsp; In passing from one of these miserable
habitations to another, Mr. Smith found an old Gipsy woman proud
of her name and descent, for she was a Lee, and a Lee of the
fourth generation.&nbsp; To this old woman he explained his
purpose, sitting on a low seat under the cover of the tent with
his knees on a level with his chin.&nbsp; He wanted, he said,
&lsquo;to get all the Gipsy tents and vans, and other movable
habitations in the country, registered and under proper sanitary
arrangements, and the children compelled to attend school
wherever they may be temporarily located, and to receive an
education which will in some degree help to get them out of the
low, heartrending condition into which they have been allowed to
sink.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Lee listened with pleasure to this
narration of Mr. Smith&rsquo;s purpose, and, though in great
poverty, desired to aid this good work.&nbsp; Her stock of cash
amounted to three-halfpence; but this she insisted upon giving,
so that she might contribute a little, at any rate, towards the
improvement of her people.&nbsp; We hope Mr. Smith may succeed in
his work, and succeed speedily, so that these Gipsy children, who
are trained up to a vagabond life, may have a chance of learning
something better.&nbsp; And evidently, from Mr. Smith&rsquo;s
experience, there is no hostility to such a measure as he wishes
to have made law among the Gipsies themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owing to my letters, papers, articles and paragraphs, and
efforts in other directions during the last several months, the
Gipsy subject might now be fairly considered to <!-- page
121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>have made good headway, consequently the proprietor of
the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, without any difficulty, was
induced&mdash;in fact, with pleasure&mdash;to have a series of
sketches of Gipsy life in his journal, the first appearing
November 29th, connected with which was the following notice, and
in which he says:&mdash;&ldquo;Our illustrations, from a sketch
taken by one of our artists in the neighbourhood of Latimer Road,
Notting Hill, which is not far from Wormwood Scrubs, show the
habits of living folk who are to be found as well in the
outskirts of London, where there are many chances of picking up a
stray bit of irregular gain, as in more rural parts of the
country.&nbsp; The figure of a gentleman introduced into this
sketch, who appears to be conversing with the Gipsies in their
waggon encampment, is that of Mr. George Smith, of Coalville,
Leicester, the well-known benevolent promoter of social reform
and legislative protection for the long-neglected class of people
employed on canal-barges, whose families, often living on board
these vessels, are sadly in want of domestic comfort and of
education for the children.&rdquo;&nbsp; The editor also inserted
my Congress paper fully.&nbsp; The following week another sketch
of Gipsy life appeared in the same journal, connected with which
were the following remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;Another sketch of the
wild and squalid habits of life still retained by vagrant parties
or clans of this singular race of people, often met with in the
neighbourhood of suburban villages and other places around
London, will be found in our journal.&nbsp; We may again direct
the reader&rsquo;s attention to the account of them which was
contributed by Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, Leicester, to the
late Social Science Congress at Manchester, and which was
reprinted in our last week&rsquo;s publication.&nbsp; That
well-known advocate of social reform and legal protection for the
neglected vagrant classes of our population reckons the total
number of Gipsies in this country at three or four thousand men
and women and ten thousand children.&nbsp; He is now seeking to
have all movable habitations&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, tents, vans,
shows, &amp;c.&mdash;in which the <!-- page 122--><a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>families
live who are earning a living by travelling from place to place,
registered and numbered, as in the case of canal-boats, and the
parents compelled to send their children to school at the place
wherever they may be temporarily located, be it National,
British, or Board school.&nbsp; The following is Mr.
Smith&rsquo;s note upon what was to be seen in the Gipsies&rsquo;
tent on Mitcham Common:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Inside this tent&mdash;with no other
home&mdash;there were two men, their wives, and about fourteen
children of all ages: two or three of these were almost men and
women.&nbsp; The wife of one of the men had been confined of a
baby the day before I called&mdash;her bed consisting of a layer
of straw upon the damp ground.&nbsp; Such was the wretched and
miserable condition they were in that I could not do otherwise
than help the poor woman, and gave her a little money.&nbsp; But,
in her feelings of gratitude to me for this simple act of
kindness, she said she would name the baby anything I would like
to chose; and, knowing that Gipsies are fond of outlandish names,
I was in a difficulty.&nbsp; After turning the thing over in my
mind for a few hours, I could think of nothing but
&ldquo;Deliverance.&rdquo;&nbsp; This seemed to please the poor
woman very much; and the poor child is named Deliverance
G---.&nbsp; Strange to say, the next older child is named
&ldquo;Moses.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On December 13th, an additional sketch, showing the inside of
a van, was given, to which were added the following
remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;Another sketch of the singular habits and
rather deplorable condition of these vagrant people, who hang
about, as the parasites of civilisation, close on the suburban
outskirts of our wealthy metropolis, is presented by our artist,
following those which have appeared in the last two weeks.&nbsp;
Mr. G. Smith, of Coalville, Leicester, having taken in hand the
question of providing due supervision and police regulation for
the Gipsies, with compulsory education for their children, we
readily dedicate these local illustrations to the furtherance of
his good work.&nbsp; The ugliest place we know in the
neighbourhood of London, the most dismal <!-- page 123--><a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>and
forlorn, is not Hackney Marshes, or those of the Lea, beyond Old
Ford, at the East-end; but it is the tract of land, half torn up
for brick-field clay, half consisting of fields laid waste in
expectation of the house-builder, which lies just outside of
Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush and Notting Hill.&nbsp; There it is that
the Gipsy encampment may be found, squatting within an
hour&rsquo;s walk of the Royal palaces and of the luxurious town
mansions of our nobility and opulent classes, to the very west of
the fashionable West-end, beyond the gentility of Bayswater and
Whiteley&rsquo;s avenue of universal shopping.&nbsp; It is a
curious spectacle in that situation, and might suggest a few
serious reflections upon social contrasts at the centre and
capital of the mighty British nation, which takes upon itself the
correction of every savage tribe in South and West Africa and
Central Asia.&nbsp; The encampment is usually formed of two or
three vans and a rude cabin or a tent, placed on some piece of
waste ground, for which the Gipsy party have to pay a few
shillings a week of rent.&nbsp; This may be situated at the back
of a row of respectable houses, and in full view of their bedroom
or parlour windows, not much to the satisfaction of the quiet
inhabitants.&nbsp; The interior of one of the vans, furnished as
a dwelling-room, which is shown in our artist&rsquo;s sketch,
does not look very miserable; but Mr. Smith informs us that these
receptacles of vagabond humanity are often sadly
overcrowded.&nbsp; Besides a man, his wife, and their own
children, the little ones stowed in bunks or cupboards, there
will be several adult persons taken in as lodgers.&nbsp; The
total number of Gipsies now estimated to be living in the
metropolitan district is not less than 2,000.&nbsp; Among these
are doubtless not a small proportion of idle runaways or
&lsquo;losels&rsquo; from the more settled classes of our
people.&nbsp; It would seem to be the duty of somebody at the
Home Office, for the sake of public health and good order, to
call upon some local authorities of the county or the parish to
look after these eccentricities of Gipsy life.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>On January 3rd, 1880, additional illustrations were
given in the <i>Illustrated London News</i>.&nbsp; 1. Tent at
Hackney; 2. Tent at Hackney; 3. Sketch near Latimer Road, Notting
Hill; 4. A Bachelor&rsquo;s Bedroom, Mitcham Common; 5.
Encampment at Mitcham Common; 6. A Knife-grinder at Hackney Wick;
7. A Tent at Hackney Marshes.&nbsp; &ldquo;A few additional
sketches, continuing those of this subject which have appeared in
our journal, are engraved for the present number.&nbsp; It is
estimated by Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, Leicester, who has
recently been exploring the queer outcast world of Gipsydom in
different parts of England, that some 2,000 people called by that
name, but of very mixed race, living in the manner of Zulu
Kaffirs rather than of European citizens, frequent the
neighbourhood of London.&nbsp; They are not all thieves, not even
all beggars and impostors, and they escape the law of vagrancy by
paying a few shillings of weekly rent for pitching their tents or
booths, and standing their waggons or wheeled cabins, on pieces
of waste ground.&nbsp; The western side of Notting Hill, where
the railway passenger going to Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush or
Hammersmith sees a vast quantity of family linen hung out to dry
in the gardens and courtyards of small dwelling-houses, bordered
towards Wormwood Scrubs by a dismal expanse of brick-fields,
might tempt the Gipsies so inclined to take a clean shirt or
petticoat&mdash;certainly not for their own wearing.&nbsp; But we
are not aware that the police inspectors and magistrates of that
district have found such charges more numerous in their official
record than has been experienced in other quarters of London; and
it is possible that honest men and women, though of irregular and
slovenly habits, may exist among this odd fragment of our motley
population.&nbsp; It is for the sake of their children, who ought
to be, at least equally with those of the English labouring
classes, since they cannot get it from their parents, provided
with means of decent Christian education, that Mr. George Smith
has brought this subject under public notice.&nbsp; <!-- page
125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>The Gipsies, so long as they refrain from picking and
stealing, and do not obstruct the highways, should not be
persecuted; for they are a less active nuisance than the Italian
organ-grinders in our city streets, whose tormenting presence we
are content to suffer, to the sore interruption both of our daily
work and our repose.&nbsp; But it is expedient that there should
be an Act of Parliament, if the Home Secretary has not already
sufficient legal powers, to establish compulsory registration of
the travelling Gipsy families, and a strict licensing system,
with constant police supervision, for their temporary
encampments, while their children should be looked after by the
local School Board.&nbsp; These measures, combined with judicious
offers of industrial help for the adults and industrial training
for the juniors, with the special exercise of Poor-Law Guardian
administration, and some parochial or missionary religious
efforts, might put an end to vagabond Gipsy life in England
before the commencement of the twentieth century, or within one
generation.&nbsp; We hope to see the matter discussed in the
House of Lords or the House of Commons during the ensuing
session; for it actually concerns the moral and social welfare of
more than thirty thousand people in our own country, which is an
interest quite as considerable as that we have in Natal or the
Transvaal, among Zulus and Basutos, and the rest of
Kaffirdom.&nbsp; The sketches we now present in illustration of
this subject are designed to show the squalid and savage aspect
of Gipsy habitations in the suburban districts, at Hackney and
Hackney Wick, north-east of London; where the marsh-meadows of
the river Lea, unsuitable for building-land, seem to forbid the
extension of town streets and blocks of brick or stuccoed
terraces; where the pleasant wooded hills of Epping and Hainault
Forest appear in the distance, inviting the jaded townsman, on
summer holidays, to saunter in the Royal Chace of the old English
kings and queens; where genuine ruralities still lie within an
hour&rsquo;s walk, of which the fashionable West-ender knoweth
nought.&nbsp; <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>There lurks the free and fearless
Gipsy scamp, if scamp he truly be, with his squaw and his
piccaninnies, in a wigwam hastily constructed of hoops and poles
and blankets, or perhaps, if he be the wealthy sheikh of his wild
Bedouin tribe, in a caravan drawn from place to place by some
lost and strayed plough-horse, the lawful owner of which is a
farmer in Northamptonshire.&nbsp; Far be it from us to say or
suspect that the Gipsy stole the horse; &lsquo;convey, the wise
it call;&rsquo; and if horse or donkey, dog, or pig, or cow, if
cock and hen, duck or turkey, be permitted to escape from field
or farmyard, these fascinated creatures will sometimes follow the
merry troop of &lsquo;Romany Rye&rsquo; quite of their own
accord, such is the magic of Egyptian craft and the innate
superiority of an Oriental race.&nbsp; These Gipsies, Zingari,
Bohemians, whatever they be called in the kingdoms of Europe, are
masters of a secret science of mysterious acquisition, as remote
from proved crime of theft or fraud as from the ways of earning
or winning by ordinary industry and trade.&nbsp; There is many a
rich and splendid establishment at the West-end supported by a
different application of the same mysterious craft.&nbsp;
Solicitors and stockbrokers may have seen it in action.&nbsp; It
is that of silently appropriating what no other person may be
quite prepared to claim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following remarks appeared in the December number of
<i>The Quiver</i>:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. George Smith, who has earned
a much-respected and worthy name by his interest in and
persevering efforts for the well-being of our canal population,
is bent on doing similar service for the Gipsy children and
roadside arabs, who are sadly too numerous in the suburban and
rural districts of the land.&nbsp; By securing the registration
of canal-boats as human domiciles, he has brought quite a host of
poor little outcasts within the pale of society and the
beneficent influence of the various educational machineries of
the age.&nbsp; By bringing the multitudinous tents, vans, shows,
and their peripatetic lodgers under some similar arrangements,
<!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>he hopes to put civilisation, education, and
Christianity within reach, of the thousand ragged Ishmaelites who
are at present left to grow up in ignorance and
degradation.&nbsp; These vagrant juveniles are growing up to
strengthen the ranks of the unproductive and criminal classes;
and policy, philanthropy, and Christianity alike demand that the
nomadic waifs should be encircled by the arms of an ameliorating
law which will give them a chance of escaping from the life of
semi-barbarity to which untoward circumstances have consigned
them, and to place them in a position to make something better of
the life that now is, and to secure some fitting preparation for
the life that is to come.&nbsp; It is evidently high time that
something should be done, otherwise we must sooner or later be
faced with more serious difficulties than even now exist.&nbsp;
Our sympathies are strongly with the warm-hearted philanthropist;
and we trust that in taking to this new field of effort he will
win all needful aid, and that his endeavours to rescue from a
life of crime and vagabondage these hitherto much-neglected
little ones will be crowned with success.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The following is my letter, relating to the poor little Gipsy
children&rsquo;s homes, as it appeared in the <i>Daily News</i>,
<i>Daily Chronicle</i>, and other London and country daily
papers, December 2nd:&mdash;&ldquo;Amongst some of the sorrowful
features of Gipsy life I have noticed lately, none call more
loudly for Government help, assistance, and supervision than the
<!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>wretched little rag and stick hovels, scarcely large
enough to hold a costermonger&rsquo;s wheelbarrow, in which the
poor Gipsy women and children are born, pig, and die&mdash;aye,
and men too, if they can be called Gipsies, with three-fourths,
excepting the faintest cheering tint, of the blood of English
scamps and vagabonds in their reins, and the remainder consisting
of the blood of the vilest rascals from India and other
nations.&nbsp; A real Gipsy of the old type, of which there are
but few, will tell you a lie and look straight at you with a
chuckle and grin; the so-called Gipsy now will tell you a lie and
look a thousand other ways while doing so.&nbsp; In their own
interest, and without mincing matters, it is time the plain facts
of their dark lives were brought to daylight, so that the
brightening and elevating effects of public opinion, law, and the
Bible may have their influence upon the character of the little
ones about to become in our midst the men and women of the
future.&nbsp; Outside their hovels or sack huts, poetically
called &lsquo;tents&rsquo; and &lsquo;encampments,&rsquo; but in
reality schools for teaching their children how to gild
double-dyed lies,&mdash;sugar-coat deception, gloss idleness and
filth, paint immorality with Asiatic ideas, notions, and hues,
and put a pleasant and cheerful aspect upon taking things that do
not belong to them, may be seen thousands of ragged, half-naked,
dirty, ignorant and wretched Gipsy children, and the men
loitering about mostly in idleness.&nbsp; Inside their sack
hovels are to be found man, wife, and six or seven children of
all ages, not one of them able to read or write, squatting or
sleeping upon a bed of straw, which through the wet and damp is
often little better than a manure-heap, in fact sometimes
completely rotten, and as a Gipsy woman told me last week,
&lsquo;it is not fit to be handled with the hands.&rsquo;&nbsp;
In noticing that many of the Gipsy children have a kind of
eye-disease, I am told by the women that it is owing to the
sulphur arising from the coke fire they have upon the ground in
their midst, and which at times also causes the children to turn
pale and sickly.&nbsp; The sulphur affects the men and <!-- page
129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>women in various ways, sometimes causing a kind of
stupor to come over them.&nbsp; I have noticed farther that many
of the adults are much pitted with small-pox.&nbsp; It is a
wonder to me that there is not more disease among them than there
appears to be, considering that they are huddled together,
regardless of sex or age, in the midst of a damp atmosphere
rising out of the ground, and impregnated with the sulphur of
their coke fires.&nbsp; Probably their flitting habits prevent
detection.&nbsp; My plan to improve their condition is not by
prosecuting them and breaking up their tents and vans and turning
them into the roads pell-mell, but to bring their habitations
under the sanitary officers and their children under the
schoolmaster in a manner analogous to the Canal Boats Act, and it
has the approval of these wandering herds.&nbsp; The process will
be slow but effective, and without much inconvenience.&nbsp;
Unless something be done for them in the way I have indicated,
they will drift into a state similar to Darwin&rsquo;s
forefathers and prove to the world that civilisation and
Christianity are a failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following article appears in the <i>Christian World</i>,
December 19th, by Christopher Crayon (J. Ewing Ritchie), in which
he says:&mdash;&ldquo;The other day I was witness to a spectacle
which made me feel a doubt as to whether I was living in the
nineteenth century.&nbsp; I was, as it were, within the shadow of
that mighty London where Royalty resides, where the richest
Church in Christendom rejoices in its Abbey and Cathedral, and
its hundreds of churches, where an enlightened and energetic
Dissent has not only planted its temples in every district, but
has sent forth its missionary agents into every land, where the
fierce light of public opinion, aided by a Press which never
slumbers, is a terror to them that do evil, and a praise to them
that do well; a city which we love to boast heads the onward
march of man; and yet the scene before me was as intensely that
of savage life, as if I had been in a Zulu kraal, and savage life
destitute of all that lends it picturesque attractions, or ideal
charms.&nbsp; I was standing in <!-- page 130--><a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>the midst
of some twenty tents and vans, inhabited by that wandering race
of whose origin we know so little, and of whose future we know
less.&nbsp; The snow was on the ground, there was frost in the
very air.&nbsp; Within a few yards was a great Board school;
close by were factories and workshops, and the other concomitants
of organised industrial life.&nbsp; Yet in that small area the
Gipsies held undisputed sway.&nbsp; In or about London there are,
it is calculated, some two thousand of these dwellers in
tents.&nbsp; In all England there are some twenty thousand of
these sons of Ishmael, with hands against every one, or, perhaps
to put it more truly, with every one&rsquo;s hands against
them.&nbsp; In summer-time their lot is by no means to be envied;
in winter their state is deplorable indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We entered, Mr. George Smith and I, and were received
as friends.&nbsp; Had I gone by myself, I question whether my
reception would have been a pleasant one.&nbsp; As Gipsies pay no
taxes, they can keep any number of dogs, and these dogs have a
way of sniffing and snarling, anything but agreeable to an
unbidden guest.&nbsp; The poor people complained to me no one
ever came to see them.&nbsp; I should be surprised if any one
did; but Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, is no common man, and
having secured fair play for the poor children of the
brick-fields&mdash;he himself was brought up in a
brick-yard&mdash;and for the poor, and sadly-neglected, inmates
of the canal-boats, he has now turned his attention to the
Gipsies.&nbsp; His idea is&mdash;and it is a good one&mdash;that
an Act of Parliament should be passed for their
benefit&mdash;something similar to that he has been the means of
carrying for the canal and brick-field children.&nbsp; In a paper
read before the Social Science Congress at Manchester, Mr. Smith
argued that all tents, shows, caravans, auctioneer vans, and like
places used as dwellings should be registered and numbered, and
under proper sanitary arrangements, with sanitary inspectors and
School Board officers, in every town and village.&nbsp; Thus in
every district the children would have their names and <!-- page
131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>attendance registered in a book, which they could take
with them from place to place, and when endorsed by the
schoolmaster, it would show that the children were attending
school.&nbsp; In carrying out this idea, it is a pity that Mr.
Smith should have to bear all the burden.&nbsp; As it is, he has
suffered greatly in his pocket by his philanthropic effort. . .
.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no joke going into a Gipsy yard, and it is still
less so when you go down on your hands and knees, and crawl into
the Gipsy&rsquo;s wigwam; but the worst of it is, when you have
done so, there is little to see after all.&nbsp; In the middle,
on a few bricks, is a stove or fireplace of some kind.&nbsp; On
the ground is a floor of wood-chips, or straw, or shavings, and
on this squat some two or three big, burly men, who make
linen-pegs and skewers, and mend chairs and various articles, the
tribe, as they wander along, seek to sell.&nbsp; The women are
away, for it is they who bring the grist to the mill, as they
tell fortunes, or sell their wares, or follow their doubtful
trade; but the place swarms with children; and it was wonderful
to see with what avidity they stretched out the dirtiest little
hand imaginable as Mr. Smith prepared to distribute some sweets
he had brought with him for that purpose.&nbsp; As we entered,
all the vans were shut up, and the tents only were occupied, the
vans being apparently deserted but presently a door was opened
half-way, and out popped a little Gipsy head, with sparkling eyes
and curly hair; and then another door opened, and a similar
spectacle was to be seen.&nbsp; Let us look into the van, about
the size of a tiny cabin, and chock full, in the first place,
with a cooking-stove; and then with shelves, with curtains and
some kind of bedding, apparently not very clean, on which the
family repose.&nbsp; It is a piteous life, even at the best, in
that van; even when the cooking pot is filled with something more
savoury than cabbages or potatoes; the usual fare; but the
children seem happy, nevertheless, in their dirty rags, and with
their luxurious heads of curly hair.&nbsp; All of them are as
ignorant as Hottentots, and lead a life horrible to think
of.&nbsp; <!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>I only saw one woman in the camp,
and I only saw her by uncovering the top and looking into the
tent in which she resides.&nbsp; She is terribly poor, she says,
and pleads earnestly for a few coppers; and I can well believe
she wants them, for in this England of ours, and especially in
the outskirts of London, the Gipsy is not a little out of
place.&nbsp; Around us are some strapping girls, one with a
wonderfully sweet smile on her face, who, if they could be
trained to domestic service, would have a far happier life than
they can ever hope to lead.&nbsp; The cold and wet seem to affect
them not, nor the poor diet, nor the smoke and bad air of their
cabins, in which they crowd, while the men lazily work, and the
mothers are far away.&nbsp; The leading lady in this camp is
absent on business; but she is a firm adherent of Mr. George
Smith, and wishes to see the children educated; and as she is a
Lee, and as a Lee in Gipsy annals take the same rank as a Norfolk
Howard in aristocratic circles, that says a good deal; but, then,
if you educate a Gipsy girl, she will want to have her hands and
face, at any rate, clean; and a Gipsy boy, when he learns to
read, will feel that he is born for a nobler end than to dwell in
a stinking wigwam, to lead a lawless life, to herd with
questionable characters, and to pick up a precarious existence at
fairs and races; and our poets and novelists and artists will not
like that.&nbsp; However, just now, by means of letters in the
newspapers, and engravings in the illustrated journals, a good
deal of attention is paid to the Gipsies, and if they can be
reclaimed and turned into decent men and women a good many
farmers&rsquo; wives will sleep comfortably at night, especially
when geese and turkeys are being fattened for Christmas fare; and
a desirable impulse will be given to the trade in
soap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the <i>Sunday School Chronicle</i>, December 19th, the
kind-hearted editor makes the following
allusions:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. George Smith stirs every feeling of
pity and compassion in our hearts by his descriptions of the
Gipsy Children&rsquo;s Homes.&nbsp; It is one of the curious
things of English life that the <!-- page 133--><a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>distinct
Gipsy race should dwell among us, and, neither socially nor
politically, nor religiously, do we take any notice of
them.&nbsp; No portion of our population may so earnestly plead,
&lsquo;No man careth for our souls.&rsquo;&nbsp; The chief
interest of them, to many of us, is that they are used to give
point, and plot, to novels.&nbsp; But can nothing be done for the
Gipsy <i>children</i>?&nbsp; Christian enterprise is seldom found
wanting when a sphere is suggested for it; and those who live in
the neighbourhood of Gipsy haunts should be especially concerned
for their well-being.&nbsp; What must the children be, morally
and religiously, who <i>bide</i>, we cannot say <i>dwell</i>, in
such homes as Mr. George Smith describes?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In their own interest, and without mincing
matters, it is time the plain facts of their dark lives were
brought to daylight, so that the brightening and elevating
effects of public opinion, law, and the Bible may have their
influence upon the character of the little ones about to become
in our midst the men and women of the future.&nbsp; Outside their
hovels or sack huts, poetically called &ldquo;tents&rdquo; and
&ldquo;encampments,&rdquo; but in reality schools for teaching
their children how to gild double-dyed lies, sugar-coat
deception, gloss idleness and filth, and put a pleasant and
cheerful aspect upon taking things that do not belong to them,
may be seen thousands of ragged, half-naked, dirty, ignorant, and
wretched Gipsy children, and the men loitering about mostly in
idleness.&nbsp; Inside their sack hovels are to be found man,
wife, and six or seven children of all ages, not one of them able
to read or write, squatting or sleeping upon a bed of straw,
which through the wet and damp is often little better than a
manure-heap, in fact sometimes it is completely rotten, and as a
Gipsy woman told me last week, &ldquo;it is not fit to be handled
with the hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; In noticing that many of the Gipsy
children have a kind of eye disease, I am told by the women that
it is owing to the sulphur arising from the coke fire they have
upon the ground in their midst, and which at times also causes
the children to turn pale and sickly.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>The following brief account of the Hungarian Gipsies of
the present day, as seen by a writer under the initials &ldquo;A.
C.,&rdquo; who visited the Unitarian Synod in Hungary last
summer, is taken from the <i>Unitarian Herald</i>, bearing date
January 9th, 1880, and in which the author says:&mdash;&ldquo;Not
far from Rugonfalva we came on a colony of exceedingly squalid
Gipsies, living in huts which a respectable Zulu would utterly
despise.&nbsp; Their appearance reminded me of Cowper&rsquo;s
graphic sketch, which I am tempted to quote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I see a column of slow-rising
smoke<br />
O&rsquo;ertop the lofty wood that skirts the wild.<br />
A vagabond and useless tribe there eat<br />
Their miserable meal.&nbsp; A kettle, flung<br />
Between two poles upon a stick transverse,<br />
Receives the morsel&mdash;flesh obscene of dog,<br />
Or vermin, or, at best, of cock purloined<br />
From his accustomed perch.&nbsp; Hard-faring race,<br />
They pick their fuel out of every hedge,<br />
Which, kindled with dry leaves, just saves unqueuched<br />
The spark of life.&nbsp; The sportive wind blows wide<br />
Their fluttering rags, and shows a tawny skin,<br />
The vellum of the livery they claim.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Transylvania is one great museum of human as well as
natural products, and this singular race forms an interesting
element of its motley population.&nbsp; It is supposed that the
tribe found its way to Hungary in the beginning of the fifteenth
century, having fled from Central Asia or India during the Mongol
reign of terror.&nbsp; About the close of last century Pastor
Benedict, of Debreczin, mastered their language, and on visiting
England found that the Gipsies in this country understood him
very well.&nbsp; There are now about eighty thousand of them in
Transylvania, but three-fourths of this number have settled
homes, and caste distinctions are so strong that the higher
grades would not drink from a cup used by one of their
half-savage brethren.&nbsp; On reaching the mansion of Mr.
Jakabh&aacute;zi, at Sim&eacute;nfalva, who employs about one
hundred and forty civilised Gipsies <!-- page 135--><a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>on his
estate, we had an opportunity after dinner of seeing them return
in a long procession from the fields.&nbsp; Some of the women
carried small brown babies, that appeared able to find footing
anywhere on their mothers&rsquo; shoulders, backs, or
breasts.&nbsp; These labourers are almost entirely paid in food
and other necessaries, and if kindly treated are very honourable
towards their master, and generally adopt his religion.&nbsp;
When smarting under any grievance, they, on the contrary,
sometimes change their faith <i>en masse</i>, and when
conciliated undergo as speedy a re-conversion.&nbsp; The women
are, as a rule, very fond of ornaments, and the men are, above
all things, proud of a horse or a pair of scarlet breeches.&nbsp;
Of late years they have in a few districts began to intermarry
with the Wallachs, and the sharp distinction between them and the
other races in Hungary will, no doubt, gradually
disappear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Weekly Times</i> again takes up the subject, and the
following appears on January 9th, 1880:&mdash;&ldquo;We made a
second expedition, with Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, on
Sunday, in search of a Gipsy encampment; and though the way was
long and tedious, and we were both lamed with walking before we
returned at night, yet we had not gone one step out of our
way.&nbsp; There is no encampment of these ancient and
interesting people in the neighbourhood of the hundred odd square
miles which composes the site of the metropolis, with which Mr.
Smith is not acquainted, and to which we verily believe he could
lead a friend if he was blindfolded.&nbsp; The way we went must
remain somewhat of a secret, because the Gipsies do not care to
see many visitors on the only day of the week which is one of
absolute rest to them.&nbsp; All that we shall disclose about the
way is, that we skirted Mount Nod, and for a short distance
looked upon the face of an ancient river, then up-hill we
clambered for many longish miles, until we turned out of a
certain lane into the encampment.&nbsp; There was a rude
picturesqueness in the gaping of the vans and tents.&nbsp; In
<!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>the foreground were the vans, to the rear the cloth
kraals, with their smoky coverings stretched over poles; from a
hole in the centre the smoke ascended, furnishing evidence that
the open brazier was burning within.&nbsp; The vans protected the
approach to the camp, just in the same way that artillery are
planted to keep the road to a military encampment.&nbsp; Mr.
Smith&rsquo;s face seemed to be well known to these strange
people, and we no sooner appeared in sight than the swinging door
of every van was edged with faces, and forth from the strange
kraals there crept child and woman, youth and dog, to say a
kindly word, or bark a welcome to the visitors.&nbsp; But for the
Gipsies&rsquo; welcome we might have had an unpleasant reception
from the dogs.&nbsp; They were evidently dubious as to our
character, their training inclining them to bite, if they get a
chance, any leg wearing black cloth, but to give the
ragged-trousered visitors a fawning welcome; so they sniffed
again and again, and growled, until driven away by the voices of
their owners.&nbsp; Perchance, during the remainder of the day,
they were revolving in their intelligent minds how it had come to
pass that the black cloth legs were received with evident marks
of favour.&nbsp; Nor were they able to settle the point easily,
for whenever we happened to look round the encampment during the
afternoon, from the raised door-way of a kraal where we happened
to be couched, we noticed the eyes of one or other of the
four-footed guardians fixed intently on us.&nbsp; There were
about twenty vans and tents in all; and each paid one shilling a
week to the ground landlord.&nbsp; That money, with whatever else
was required for food, was obtained by hawking at this season of
the year, and trade was very bad.&nbsp; Winter must be a fearful
experience for these children of the air, and the field, the
summer sun, the wild flowers, and the fruits of harvest.&nbsp;
Such rains as have descended, such snows as have been falling,
such cold winds as have been blowing, must discount fearfully the
joys of the three happier seasons of the year.</p>
<p><!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>&ldquo;Invitations to stoop and enter any
&lsquo;tent&rsquo; were freely tendered, and &lsquo;peeps&rsquo;
were indulged in with regard to a few.&nbsp; In one, a closed
cauldron covered the brazier fire, and two men and a dog watched
with unceasing vigilance.&nbsp; We tried to make friends here,
but failed.&nbsp; There was a steamy exudation from the cauldron
which filled the air with fragrance, and our curiosity overcame
our prudence, but with no satisfactory result.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
stew,&rsquo; we suggested.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes! it was summut
stewing.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we guess what it
was?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Not soon,&rsquo; was the reply; &lsquo;a
few bones and a potato or two; perhaps a bit of something
green.&nbsp; At such hard times they were mostly glad to get
anything.&rsquo;&nbsp; But nothing more could be gleaned, and the
two men and the dog never lost sight of the cauldron while the
visitors remained.&nbsp; In a few cases the tents were pegged
down all round, and across the top, upon a stout line, there hung
a few articles fresh from the wash.&nbsp; The pegged cloth
indicated that the female occupants were within, but &lsquo;not
at home,&rsquo; nor would they be visible until the wind had
dried the garments that fluttered overhead.&nbsp; We tarried, and
were made quite at home in another kraal, where we gleaned many
interesting particulars of Gipsy life; and here we held a sort of
smoking <i>lev&eacute;e</i>, and were honoured by the company of
many distinguished residents in camp.&nbsp; We lay upon a bed of
straw, which covered the whole of the interior, save a little
space filled with the brazier, in which a fire of coke was
burning; above was a hole, out of which the smoke passed.&nbsp;
The straw had been stamped into consistency by the feet of the
family; there was no odour from it, and in that particular was an
improvement on the rush and straw floors in the English houses of
which Erasmus made such great complaint.&nbsp; There was no
chair, stool, or box on which to sit, and all of us reclined
Eastern fashion in the posture that was most convenient.&nbsp;
The owner of the kraal and his wife were very interesting people:
the mother&rsquo;s hair descended by little steps from the crown
of her head, until it stuck out <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>like a
bush, in a line with the nape of her neck, a dense dead-black
mass of hair.&nbsp; She had been a model for painters many a
time, she said, before small-pox marked her; and, since, the back
of her head had often been drawn to fit somebody else&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When I come again what shall I bring you?&rsquo;
said Mr. Smith, in most reckless fashion, to the Egyptian
Queen.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said she, without a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation, &lsquo;if there is one thing more than
another that I do want, it&rsquo;s a silk handkercher for my
head&mdash;a real Bandana.&rsquo;&nbsp; The request was
characteristic.&nbsp; Of the tales we heard one or two were
curious, one positively laughable, and one related to a deed of
blood.&nbsp; Mr. Smith, going into a tent, found an aged Gipsy
woman, to whom he told the object of his visiting the Gipsies,
and what he hoped to accomplish for the children, and she forwith
handed him a money gift.&nbsp; On more than one occasion a
well-polished silver coin of small value, a penny, or a farthing
has been quietly put into Mr. Smith&rsquo;s hands, in furtherance
of his work, by some poor Gipsy woman.&nbsp; The story which made
us laugh was of a Gipsy marriage.&nbsp; It is one of the
unwritten laws of Gipsy life that the wife works while the
husband idles about the tent.&nbsp; The wife hawks with the
basket or the cart and sells, while the husband loiters about the
encampment or cooks the evening meal.&nbsp; But one young Gipsy
fell in love with an Irish girl named Kathleen, and from the day
of their marriage Tom never had an idle moment.&nbsp; In vain did
he plead the usages of Gipsy married life.&nbsp; Kathleen was
deaf to all such modes of argument, and drove her husband forth
from tent and encampment, by voice or by stake, until she
completely cured him of his idleness, and she remained mistress
of the field.&nbsp; Whenever a young Gipsy is supposed to be
courting a stranger, the fate of Tom at the hands of Kathleen is
told him as a warning.&nbsp; During the afternoon we were
continually exhorted to see &lsquo;Granny&rsquo; before we
left.&nbsp; Every one spoke of her with respect, and when we were
<!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>about to leave, Patience offered to show us
&lsquo;Granny&rsquo;s tent.&rsquo;&nbsp; Repentance joined her
sister, and before we were up and out of the tent opening, we saw
Patience at a tent not far off; she dived head and shoulders
through an opening she made, and then appeared to be pulling
vigorously.&nbsp; Her activity was soon explained.&nbsp; We
thrust our heads through the opening, and were face to face with
a shrivelled-faced old woman, whose cheeks were like discoloured
parchment, and whose hands and arms appeared to be mere
bones.&nbsp; But her eye was bright, and her tongue proved her to
be in possession of most of her faculties.&nbsp; She could not
stand or walk, nor could she sit up for many minutes at a time,
and the action of Patience was caused by her hastily seizing the
old woman by her arms as she lay on her straw floor, and dragging
her into a sitting position.&nbsp; If the old dame had been
asleep, Patience had thoroughly aroused her.&nbsp; She greeted us
with Gipsy courtesy, and told us she was &lsquo;fourscore and six
years of age.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her name, in answer to our query, she
said was &lsquo;Sinfire Smith.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,
that&rsquo;s the same as mine,&rsquo; said Mr. Smith.&nbsp;
&lsquo;O, likely,&rsquo; said Sinfire, &lsquo;the Smiths is a
long family.&rsquo;&nbsp; For four score and six years poor
Sinfire has led a Gipsy life, and though her house now is only a
tent, and her bed and bedding straw, she made no moan, and there
was nothing she wished to have.&rdquo;</p>

The Treatment the Gipsies have received in this Country.</h2>
<p>The social history and improvements of our own country seem to
have gone by irregular leaps and bounds.&nbsp; The Parliament,
like the <i>Times</i>, follows upon the heels of public opinion
in all measures concerning the welfare of the nation; and it is
well it should be so.&nbsp; An Englishman will be led by a child;
but it requires a strong hand and a sharp whip to drive
him.&nbsp; One hundred and forty years ago the Wesleys and
Whitfield caused a commotion in the religious world.&nbsp;
Upwards of a century ago the first canal in this country was
opened for the conveyance of goods upon our silent highways, and
trade began in earnest to show signs of life and activity.&nbsp;
A century ago Robert Raikes, of Gloucester, opened his first
Sunday-school&mdash;the beginning of a system ever widening and
expanding, carrying with it blessings incomprehensible to finite
minds, and only to be revealed in another world.&nbsp; Nearly a
century ago Raper&rsquo;s translation of Grellmann&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Dissertation on the Gipsies&rdquo; was published, and
which caused no little stir at the time, being the first work of
any kind worth notice that had appeared.&nbsp; Seventy years ago
an interesting correspondence took place in the <i>Christian
Observer</i> upon the condition of the Gipsies, and various lines
of missionary action were suggested; but no plan was adopted, and
all words blown to the wind.&nbsp; Then, as now, people would
look at the Gipsies <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>in their pitiable condition, and
with a shrug of the shoulders would say, &ldquo;Poor
things,&rdquo; and away they would go to their mansions, doff
their warm winter clothing, put on their needleworked slippers,
stretch their legs before a blazing fire in the drawing-room, and
call &ldquo;John&rdquo; to bring a box of the best cigars, the
champagne, dry sherry, and crusted port, and then noddle off to
sleep.&nbsp; Sixty-four years ago Hoyland&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Historical Survey of the Gipsies&rdquo; made its
appearance, a work that caught the fire and spirit of
Grellmann&rsquo;s, the object of both being to stir up the
missionary zeal of this country in the cause of the
Gipsies.&nbsp; Fifty years ago James Crabb began his missionary
work among the Gipsies at Southampton, and for a while did well;
but in course of time, owing to the Gipsies moving about, as in
the case of &ldquo;Our Canal Population,&rdquo; the work dwindled
down and down, till there is not a vestige of this good
man&rsquo;s efforts to be seen.&nbsp; About the same time that
Crabb was at work among the Gipsies missionary efforts were put
in motion to improve the canal-boatmen, and mission stations were
established at Newark, Stoke-on-Trent, Aylesbury, Oxford,
Birmingham, and other places, but fared the same fate as the
missionary effort of Crabb and others among the Gipsies.&nbsp;
Fifty years ago railways were opened, which gave an impetus to
trade never experienced before.&nbsp; Fifty years ago the
preaching of Bourne and Clowes was causing considerable
excitement in the country.&nbsp; Nearly fifty years ago witnessed
the passing of the Reform Bill, and the Factory Act received the
Royal signature.&nbsp; Forty years have passed away since George
Borrow&rsquo;s missionary efforts among the Gipsies were
prominently before the public, which, sad to say, shared the fate
of Crabb&rsquo;s, Hoyland&rsquo;s, Roberts&rsquo;, and
Raper&rsquo;s.&nbsp; From that day till now, except the spasmodic
efforts of a clergyman here and there, or some other kind-hearted
friend, these 20,000 poor slighted outcasts have been left to
themselves to sink or swim as they thought well.&nbsp; The only
man, except the dramatist and novelist, who has seemed <!-- page
142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>to
notice them has been the policeman, and his vigilant eye and
staff have been used to drive them from their camping-ground from
time to time, and thus&mdash;if possible&mdash;made their lives
more miserable, and created within them deeper-seated revenge,
owing to the way in which they are carrying out the Enclosures
Act.&nbsp; All missionary efforts put forth to improve the
condition of the factory operative and canal-boatmen, previous to
the passing of the Factory Act, nearly fifty years since, and the
Canal Boats Act of 1877, were fruitless and unprofitable.&nbsp;
The passing of the Factory Act has done more for the children in
one year than all the missionaries in the kingdom could have done
in their lifetime.&nbsp; Similar results are the outcome of the
Brickyard Act of 1871, as touching the welfare of the
children.&nbsp; And so in like manner it will be with the Canal
Boats Act when properly carried out, the canal-boat children of
to-day, in fifty years hence, will be equal to other working
classes.&nbsp; From the days of Hoyland, and Borrow, and Crabb,
down to the present time, but little seems to have been done for
the Gipsies.&nbsp; With Crabb died all real interest in the
welfare of these poor unfortunate people.&nbsp; The difficulties
he had encountered seemed to have had a deterrent effect upon
others.&nbsp; Missionary zeal, without moral force of law and the
schoolmaster, will accomplish but little for the Gipsies at our
doors; and it may be said with special emphasis as regards the
improvement of the Gipsy children.&nbsp; From the days of the
relentless, cruel, and merciless persecution the Gipsies received
under the reigns of Henry VIII. and Elizabeth, down to the
present time, nothing has been done by law to reclaim these
Indian outcasts and Asiatic emigrants.&nbsp; The case of the
Gipsies shows us plainly that hunting the women and children with
bloodhounds, and dragging the Gipsy leaders to the gallows, will
neither stamp them out nor improve their character and habits;
and, on the other hand, it appears that the love-like gentleness,
child-like simplicity, and religious fervour of the circumscribed
influence <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>of Crabb and others, about this
time, did but little for these poor, little, dark-eyed, wandering
brethren of ours from afar.&nbsp; The next agents that appeared
upon the scene to try to elevate the Gipsies into something like
a respectable position in society were the dramatists and
novelists.&nbsp; These flickering lights of the night have met
with no better success, in fact, their efforts, in the way they
have been put forth, have, as a rule, exhibited Gipsy life in a
variety of false colours and shades, which exhibition has turned
out to be a failure in accomplishing the object the authors had
in view, other than to fill their coffers and mislead the public
as to the real character of a Gipsy vagabond&rsquo;s life; and
thus it will be seen, I think, that the Gipsies and their
children of to-day present to us the miserable failure, of bitter
persecution in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the
efforts of Christianity alone at the beginning of the nineteenth
century, and more recently the novelist and dramatist as a means
in themselves, separately, to effect a reformation in the habits
and character of the Gipsy children and their parents.</p>
<p>If the Gipsy and other tramping, travelling &ldquo;rob
rats&rdquo; of to-day are to become honest, industrious, and
useful citizens of the future, it must be by the influence of the
schoolmaster and the sanitary officer, coming to a great extent
as they do between the fitful and uncertain efforts of the
missionary, the relentless hands of persecution, the policeman,
and the stage.</p>
<p>From the time the Gipsies landed in this country in 1515, down
to the time when Raper&rsquo;s translation of Grellmann&rsquo;s
work appeared in 1787, a period of 272 years, nothing seems to
have been done to improve the Gipsies, except to pass laws for
their extermination.&nbsp; The earliest notice of the Gipsies in
our own country was published in a quarto volume in the year
1612, the object of which was to expose the system of
fortune-telling, juggling, and legerdemain, and in which
reference is made to the <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>Gipsies as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;This kind of people about a hundred years
ago beganne to gather an head, as the first heere about the
southerne parts.&nbsp; And this, as I am imformed and can gather,
was their beginning: Certain Egyptians banished their country
(belike not for their good conditions) arrived heere in England,
who for quaint tricks and devices, not known heere at that time
among us, were esteemed and had in great admiration; insomuch
that many of our English loyterers joined with them, and in time
learned their crafty cosening.&nbsp; The speech which they used
was the right Egyptian language, with whom our Englishmen
conversing at least learned their language.&nbsp; These people
continuing about the country and practising their cosening art,
purchased themselves great credit among the country people, and
got much by palmistry and telling of fortunes; insomuch they
pitifully cosened poor country girls, both of money, silver
spoons, and the best of their apparalle or other goods they could
make.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he goes on to say, &ldquo;But what numbers
were executed on these statutes you would wonder; yet,
notwithstanding, all would not prevaile, but they wandered as
before uppe and downe and meeting once a year at a place
appointed; sometimes at the Peake&rsquo;s Hole in Derbyshire, and
other whiles by Ketbroak at Blackheath.&rdquo;&nbsp; The annual
gathering of the Gipsies and others of the same class, who make
Leicestershire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire and
neighbouring counties, their head-quarters, takes place at the
well-known Bolton Fair, held about Whitsuntide, on the borders of
Leicestershire, a village situated in a kind of triangle, between
Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.&nbsp; Spellman
speaks of the Gipsies about this time as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The worst kind of wanderers and impostors
springing up on the Continent, but yet rapidly spreading
themselves through Britain and other parts of Europe, disfigured
by their swarthiness, sun-burnt, filthy in their clothing and
indecent in all their customs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Under these
circumstances it is not to be wondered at, in these dark ages,
<!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>that some steps should be taken to stop these lawless
desperadoes and vagabonds from contaminating our English
labourers&rsquo; and servant girls with their loose ideas of
labour, cleanliness, honesty, morality, truthfulness, and
religion.&nbsp; It was soon manifest what kind of strange people
had begun to flock to our shores to make their domiciles among
us, as will be seen in a description given of them in an Act of
Parliament passed in the twenty-second year of the reign of Henry
VIII., being only about seven years after their landing in
Scotland, and to which I have referred before.&nbsp; In the tenth
chapter of the said act they are described as&mdash;&ldquo;An
outlandish people calling themselves Egyptians, using no crafte
nor feat of merchandise; who have come into this realm and gone
from shire to shire and place to place in great company, and used
great subtle and crafty means to deceive the people, bearing them
in hand that by palmistry they could tell the men&rsquo;s and
women&rsquo;s fortunes, and so many times by crafte and subtlety
have deceived the people of their money, and also have committed
many heinous felonies and robberies.&nbsp; Wherefore all are
directed to avoid the realm and not to return under pain of
imprisonment and forfeitures of their goods and chattels; and on
their trials for any felonies which they may have committed they
shall not be entitled to a jury.&rdquo;&nbsp; As if this was not
sufficient or as if it had not the desired effect the authors
anticipated viz., in preventing other Gipsies flocking to our
shores or driving those away from us who were already in our
midst another act was passed in the twenty-seventh year of the
same reign, more severe than the previous act, and part of it
runs as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Whereas certain outlandish people,
who do not profess any crafte or trade, whereby to maintain
themselves, but go about in great numbers from place to pace
using insidious underhand means to impose on His Majesty&rsquo;s
subjects, making them believe that they understand the art of
foretelling to men and women their good and evil fortunes by
looking in their hands, whereby they <!-- page 146--><a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>frequently
defraud people of their money; likewise are guilty of thefts and
highway robberies; it is hereby ordered that the said vagrants,
commonly called Egyptians, in case they remain one month in the
kingdom, shall be proceeded against as thieves and rascals, and
at the importation of such Egyptians (the importer) shall forfeit
&pound;40 for every trespass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fine of &pound;40 being inflicted at that time, which
means a large sum at the present day, carries something more with
it than the thefts committed by the Gipsies.&nbsp; It is evident
that the Gipsies had wheedled themselves into the graces and
favours of some portion of the aristocracy by their crafts and
deception.&nbsp; If the Gipsy offences had been committed against
the labouring population it would have been the height of
absurdity for Parliament to have inflicted a fine of some
hundreds of pounds upon the working man of the poorer
classes.&nbsp; It has occurred to me that the question of Popery
may have been one of the causes of their persecution; and it is
not unlikely that wealthy Roman Catholics may have had something
to do with their importation into this country.&nbsp; The fact
is, before the Gipsies left the Continent for England they were
Roman Catholic pilgrims, and going about the country doing the
work of the Pope to some extent, and this may have been one of
the objects of those who were opposed to the Protestant
tendencies of Henry VIII. in causing them to come over to
England.&nbsp; At this time our own country was in a very
disturbed state, religiously, and no people were so suitable to
work in the dark and carry messages from place to place as the
Gipsies, especially if by so doing they could make plenty of
plunder out of it; and this idea I have hinted at before as one
of their leading characteristics.&nbsp; It should not be
overlooked that telegraphs, railways, stagecoaches, and canals
had not been established at this time, consequently for the
Gipsies to be moving about the country from village to village
under a cloak, as they appeared to the <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>higher
powers, was sufficient to make them the subjects of bitter
persecution.&nbsp; For the Gipsies to have openly avowed that
they were Roman Catholics before landing upon our shores, would
in all probability have defeated the object of those who
induced&mdash;if induced&mdash;them to come over to
Britain.&nbsp; At any rate, we may, I think, fairly assume that
this feature of their character, an addition to their
fortune-telling proclivities, may have been one of the causes of
their persecution, and in this view I am to some extent supported
by circumstances.</p>
<p>During the reign of Henry VIII. a number of Gipsies were sent
back to France, and in the book of receipts and payments of the
thirty-fifth of the same reign the following entries are
made:&mdash;&ldquo;Nett payments, 1st Sept., 36 of Henry
VIII.&nbsp; Item, to Tho. Warner, Sergeant of the Admyraltie,
10th Sept., for victuals prepared for a shippe appointed to
convey certaine Egupeians, 58s.&nbsp; Item, to the same Tho.
Warner, to the use of John Bowles for freight of said shippe,
&pound;6 5s.&nbsp; 0d.&nbsp; Item, to Robt. ap Rice, Esq., Shriff
of Huntingdon, for the charge of the Egupeians at a special gailo
delivery, and the bringing of them to be carreied over the sees;
over and besides the sum of &pound;4 5s. 0d. groming of seventeen
horses sold at five shillings the peice as apperythe by a
particular book, &pound;17 17s. 7d.&nbsp; Item, to Will. Wever,
appointed to have the charge of the conduct of the said Egupeians
to Callis, &pound;5.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1426 a first-rate horse was worth about &pound;1 6s. 8d.,
and a colt 4s. 6d.&nbsp; Twenty-two years later the hay of an
acre of land was worth about &pound;5.</p>
<p>There were several acts passed relating to the Gipsies during
the reign of Philip and Mary, and fifth of Elizabeth, by which it
states&mdash;&ldquo;If any person, being fourteen years old,
whether natural born subject or stranger, who had been seen in
the fellowship of such persons, or had disguised himself like
them, or should remain with them one month at once or several
times, it should be felony without the benefit of the
clergy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Wraxall, in his &ldquo;History of
France,&rdquo; vol. ii., <!-- page 148--><a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>page 32, in
referring to the act of Elizabeth, in 1653, states that in her
reign the Gipsies throughout England were supposed to exceed
10,000.&nbsp; About the year 1586 complaints were again made of
the increase of vagabonds and loitering persons.</p>
<p>The following order is copied from the Harleian MSS. in the
British Museum:&mdash;&ldquo;Orders, rules, and directions,

<p><!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>In Scotland, the Gipsies, and other vagrants of the
same class, were dealt with equally as severely under Mary Queen
of Scots as they were under Henry VIII. and Elizabeth in
England.&nbsp; In an act passed in 1579 I find the following
relating to Gipsies and vagabonds:&mdash;&ldquo;That sik as make
themselves fules and ar bairdes, or uther sik like runners about,
being apprehended, sall be put into the Kinge&rsquo;s Waird, or
irones, sa lang as they have ony gudes of their owin to live on,
and fra they have not quhair upon to live of thir owin that their
eares be nayled to the trone or to an uther tree, and thir eares
cutted off and banished the countrie; and gif thereafter they be
found againe, that they be hanged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that it may be knowen quwhat maner of persones ar
meaned to be idle and strong begares, and vagabounds, and worthy
of the punischment before specified, it is declared: That all
idle persones ganging about in any countrie of this realm, using
subtil craftie and unlawful playes, as juglarie, fast-and-lous,
and sik uthers; the idle people calling themselves
<i>Egyptians</i>, or any uther, that feinzies themselves to have
a knowledge or charming prophecie, or other abused sciences,
quairby they perswade peopil that they can tell thir weirds,
deaths, and fortunes, and sik uther phantastical
imaginations,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
<p>Another law was passed in Scotland in 1609, not less severe
than the one passed in 1579, called Scottish Acts, and in which I
find the following:&mdash;&ldquo;Sorcerers, common thieves,
commonly called Egyptians, were directed to pass forth of the
kingdom, under pain of death as common, notorious, and condemned
thieves.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was persecution with vengeance, and no
mistake; and it was under this kind of treatment, severe as it
was, the Gipsies continued to grow and prosper in carrying out
their nefarious practices.&nbsp; The case of these poor miserable
wretches, midnight prowlers, with eyes and hearts and bending
steps determined upon mischief and evil-doing, presents to us the
spectacle of justice untempered with mercy.&nbsp; The phial
filled with <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>revenge, malice, spite, hatred,
extermination and blood&mdash;without the milk of human kindness,
the honey of love, water from the crystal fountain, and the
tincture of Gethsemane&rsquo;s garden being added to take away
the nauseousness of it&mdash;being handed these poor deluding
witches and wretches to drink to the last dregs, failed to get
rid of social and national grievances.&nbsp; The hanging of
thirteen Gipsies at one of the Suffolk Assizes a few years before
the Restoration carried with it none of the seeds of a
reformation in their character and habits, nor did it lessen the
number of these wandering prowlers, for we find that from the
landing of a few hundred of Gipsies from France in 1514, down to
the commencement of the eighteenth century, the number had
increased to something like 15,000.&nbsp; The number who had been
hung, died in prison, suffered starvation, and the fewness of
those who were Christians, and gone to heaven, during the period
of over 250 years, and prior to the noble efforts of Raper, Sir
Joseph Banks, Hoyland, Crabb, Borrow, and others, is fearful to
contemplate.&nbsp; Hoyland tells us that in his day, &ldquo;not
one Gipsy in a thousand could read or write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Efforts put forth to exterminate these Asiatic heathens,
babble-mongers, and bush-ranging thieves, were not confined to
England alone.&nbsp; King Ferdinand of Spain was the first to set
the persecuting machine at work to grind them to powder, and
passed an edict in the year 1492 for their extermination, which
only drove them into hiding-places, to come out, with their
mouths watering, in greater numbers, for fresh acts of violence
and plunder.&nbsp; At the King&rsquo;s death, the Emperor Charles
V. persecuted them afresh, but with no success, and the
consequence was they were left alone in Spain to pursue their
course of robbery and crime for more than 200 years.&nbsp; In
France an edict was passed by Francis I.&nbsp; At a Council of
the State of Orleans an order was sent to all Governors to drive
the Gipsies out of the country with fire and the sword.&nbsp;
Under this edict <!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>they still increased, and a new
order was issued in 1612 for their extermination.&nbsp; In 1572
they were driven from the territories of Milan and Parma, and
earlier than this date they were driven beyond the Venetian
jurisdiction.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is the sound of fetters&mdash;sound of
work<br />
Is not so dismal.&nbsp; Hark! they pass along.<br />
I know it is those Gipsy prisoners;<br />
I saw them, heard their chains.&nbsp; O! terrible<br />
To be in chains.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Denmark they were not allowed to pass about the country
unmolested, and every magistrate was ordered to take them into
custody.&nbsp; A very sharp and severe order came out for their
expulsion from Sweden in the year 1662.&nbsp; Sixty-one years
later a second order was published by the Diet; and in 1727
additional stringent measures were added to the foregoing
edicts.&nbsp; Under pain of death they were excluded from the
Netherlands by Charles V., and in 1582 by the United
Provinces.&nbsp; Germany seems to have led the van in passing
laws for their extermination.&nbsp; At the Augsburg Diet in 1500,
Maximillian I. had the following edict drawn
up:&mdash;&ldquo;Respecting those people who call themselves
Gipsies roving up and down the country.&nbsp; By public edict to
all ranks of the empire, according to the obligations under which
they are bound to us and the Holy Empire, it is strictly ordered
that in future they do not permit the said Gipsies (since there
is authentic evidence of their being spies, scouts, and conveyers
of intelligence, betraying the Christians to the Turks) to pass
or remain within their territories, nor to trade or traffic,
neither to grant them protection nor convoy, and that the said
Gipsies do withdraw themselves before Easter next ensuing from
the German Dominions, entirely quit them, nor suffer themselves
to be found therein.&nbsp; As in case they should transgress
after this time, and receive injury from any person, they shall
have no redress, nor shall such persons be thought to have
committed <!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>any crime.&rdquo;&nbsp; Grellmann
says the same affair occupied the Diet in 1530, 1544, 1548, and
1551, and was also enforced in the stringent police regulations
of Frankfort in 1577, and he goes on to say that with the
exception of Hungary and Transylvania, they were similarly
proscribed in every civilised state.&nbsp; I think it will be
seen by the foregoing German edict that there is some foundation
for the supposition I have brought forward earlier, viz., that
the persecution of the Gipsies in this country was not so much on
account of their thieving deeds, plunder, and other abominations,
as their connection with the emissaries of the Pope of Rome, and
in the secrecy of their movements in going from village to
village, undermining the foundation of the State, law, and order,
civil and religious liberty.&nbsp; The only bright spot and
cheerful tint upon this sorrowful picture of persecution which
took place in our own country during these dark ages was the
appearance of the Star of Elstow, John Bunyan, the Bedfordshire
tinker, whose life and death forcibly illustrates the last words
of Jesus upon the Cross, &ldquo;Father, forgive them, they know
not what they do.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twere ill to banish hope and let the
mind<br />
Drift like a feather.&nbsp; I have had my share<br />
Of what the world calls trial.&nbsp; Once a fire<br />
Came in the darkness, when the city lay<br />
In a still sea of slumber, stretching out<br />
Great lurid arms which stained the firmament;<br />
And when I woke the room was full of sparks,<br />
And red tongues smote the lattice.&nbsp; Then a hand<br />
Came through the sulphur, taking hold of mine,<br />
And the next moment there were shouts of joy.<br />
Ah! I was but a child and my first care<br />
Was for my mother.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Harris</span>
(the Cornish poet).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Towards the end of the eighteenth century it became evident
that edicts and persecutions were not going to stamp out the
Gipsies in this country, for instead of them decreasing in
numbers they kept increasing; at this time there <!-- page
154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>were supposed to be about 18,000 in the country.&nbsp;
The following sad case, showing the malicious spirits of the
Gipsies, and the relentless hand of the hangman, seemed to have
had the effect of bringing the authorities to bay.&nbsp; They had
begun to put their &ldquo;considering caps&rdquo; on, and were in
a fix as to the next move, and it was time they had.&nbsp; They
had never thought of tempering justice with mercy.&nbsp; A
century ago, 1780, a number of young Gipsies were arrested at
Northampton, upon what charge it does not appear.&nbsp; It should
be noted that Northamptonshire at this time was a favourite round
for the Gipsy fraternity as well as the adjoining counties.&nbsp;
This, it seems, excited the feelings of the Gipsies in the
county, and they sought to obtain the release of the young
Gipsies who were in custody, but were not successful in their
application to the magistrate; the consequence was&mdash;true to
their instincts&mdash;the spirit of revenge manifested itself to
such a degree that the Gipsies threatened to set fire to the
town, and would, in all probability have carried it out had not a
number of them been brought to the gallows for these
threats.&nbsp; With this case the hands of persecution began to
hang down, for it was evident that persecution <i>alone</i> would
neither improve these Gipsies nor yet drive them out of the
country.&nbsp; The tide of events now changed.&nbsp; Law, rigid,
stern justice alone could do no good with them, and consequently
handed them over to the minister of love and mercy.&nbsp; This
step was a bound to the opposite extreme, and as we go along we
shall see that the efforts put forth in this direction alone met
with but little more success than under the former
treatment.&nbsp; Seven years after the foregoing executions
Grellmann&rsquo;s work upon the Gipsies appeared, which caused a
considerable commotion among the religious communities,
following, as it did, the universal feeling aroused in the
welfare of the children of this country by the establishment of
Sunday-schools throughout the length and breadth of the land to
teach the children of the working-classes reading and writing and
<!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>the fundamental principles of Christianity.&nbsp; After
repeated efforts put forth by a number of Christian gentlemen,
and the interest caused by the publication of Grellmann&rsquo;s
book, the work of reforming the Gipsies by purely religious and
philanthropic action began to lag behind; the result was, as in
the case of persecution, no good was observable, and the Gipsies
were allowed to go again on their way to destruction.&nbsp; The
next step was one in the right direction, viz., that of trying to
improve the Gipsies by the means of the schoolmaster; although
humble and feeble in its plan of operation, yet if we look to the
agency put forth and its results, the Sunday-school teacher must
have felt encouraged in his work as he plodded on Sunday after
Sunday.</p>
<p>It may be said of Thomas Howard as it was said of the poor
widow of old, he &ldquo;hath done more than them
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; The following account of this cheerful,
encouraging, and interesting gathering is taken from Hoyland, in
which he says:&mdash;&ldquo;The first account he received of any
of them was from Thomas Howard, proprietor of a glass and china
shop, No. 50, Fetter Lane, Fleet Street.&nbsp; This person, who
preached among the Calvinists, said that in the winter of 1811 he
had assisted in the establishment of a Sunday-school in Windwill
Street, Acre Lane, near Clapham.&nbsp; It was under the patronage
of a single gentlewoman, of the name of Wilkinson, and
principally intended for the neglected and forlorn children of
brick-makers and the most abject poor.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the
present day Gipsies generally locate in the neighbourhood of
brick-yards and low, swampy marshes, or by the side of rivers or
canals.&nbsp; It was begun on a small scale, but increased till
the number of scholars amounted to forty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the winter a family of Gipsies, of the name of
Cooper, obtained lodgings at a house opposite the school.&nbsp;
Trinity Cooper, a daughter of the Gipsy family, who was about
thirteen years of age, applied to be instructed at the school;
but in consequence of the obloquy affixed to that description of
persons she was repeatedly refused.&nbsp; She <!-- page 156--><a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>nevertheless persevered in her importunity, till she
obtained admission for herself and two of her brothers.&nbsp;
Thomas Howard says, surrounded as he was by ragged children,
without shoes and stockings, the first lesson he taught them was
silence and submission.&nbsp; They acquired habits of
subordination and became tractable and docile; and of all his
scholars there were not any more attentive and affectionate than
these; and when the Gipsies broke up in the spring, to make their
usual excursions, the children expressed much regret at leaving
school.&nbsp; This account was confirmed by Thomas Jackson, of
Brixton Row, minister of Stockwell Chapel, who said:&mdash;Since
the above experiment, several Gipsies had been admitted to a
Sabbath-school under the direction of his congregation.&nbsp; At
their introduction, he compared them to birds when first put into
the cage, which flew against the sides of it, having no idea of
restraint; but by a steady, even care over them, and the
influence of the example of other children, they soon become
settled and fell into their ranks.&rdquo;&nbsp; The next step
taken to let daylight upon the Gipsy and his dark doings in the
dark ages was by means of letters to the Press, and what
surprises me is that this step, the most important of all, was
not taken before.</p>
<p>In a letter addressed to the <i>Christian Observer</i>, vol.
vii., p. 91, in the year about 1809, &ldquo;Nil&rdquo;
writes:&mdash;&ldquo;As the divine spirit of Christianity deems
no object, however uncouth or insignificant, beneath her notice,
I venture to apply to you on behalf of a race, the outcasts of
society, of whose pitiable condition, among the many forms of
human misery which have engaged your efforts, I do not recollect
to have seen any notice in the pages of your excellent
miscellany.&nbsp; I allude to the deplorable state of the
Gipsies, on whose behalf I beg leave to solicit your good offices
with the public.&nbsp; Lying at our very doors, they seem to have
a peculiar claim on our compassion.&nbsp; In the midst of a
highly refined state of society, they are but little removed from
savage life.&nbsp; In this happy country, where the light of
Christianity shines <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>with its purest lustre, they are
still strangers to its cheering influence.&nbsp; I have not heard
even of any efforts which have been made either by individuals or
societies for their improvement.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fraternicus,&rdquo; writing to the same Journal, vol.
vii., and in the same year, says:&mdash;&ldquo;It is painful to
reflect how many thousands of these unhappy creatures have, since
the light of Christianity has shone on this island, gone into
eternity ignorant of the ways of salvation;&rdquo; and goes on to
say that, &ldquo;there is an awful responsibility attached to
this neglect,&rdquo; and recommends the appointment of
missionaries to the work; and finishes his appeal as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Christians of various denominations,
perhaps may, through the divine providence, be the means of
exciting effectual attention to the spiritual wants of this
deplorable set of beings; and the same benevolence which induced
you to exert your talents and influence on behalf of the
oppressed negroes may again be successfully employed in
ameliorating the condition of a numerous class of our
fellow-creatures.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;H.&rdquo; wrote to the
<i>Christian Observer</i>, and said he hoped &ldquo;to see the
day when the nation, which has at length done justice to the poor
negroes, will be equally zealous to do their duty in this
instance,&rdquo; and he offered to subscribe &ldquo;twenty pounds
per annum towards so good an object.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Minimus,&rdquo; another writer to the same paper, with
reference to missionary enterprise, says:&mdash;&ldquo;The soil
which it is proposed to cultivate is remarkably barren and
unpropitious; of course, a plentiful harvest must not be soon
expected;&rdquo; and finishes his letter by saying, &ldquo;Let us
arise and build; let us begin; there is no fear of progress and
help.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;H.,&rdquo; a clergyman, writes again
and says:&mdash;&ldquo;Surely, when our charity is flowing in so
wide a channel, conveying the blessings of the Gospel to the most
distant quarters of the globe, we shall not hesitate to water
this one barren and neglected field in our own land.&nbsp; My
attention was drawn to the state of this miserable class of human
beings by the letter of &lsquo;Fraternicus,&rsquo; and looking
upon it as a reproach to our country;&rdquo; and ends his letter
<!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>with a short prayer, as follows: &ldquo;It is my
earnest prayer to God that this may not be one of these projects
which are only talked of and never begun; but that it may tend to
the glory of His name and to the bringing back of these poor lost
sheep to the fold of their Redeemer.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;J.
P.&rdquo; writes to the same Journal, April 28, 1810, in which he
says:&mdash;&ldquo;Circumstances lead to think that were
encouragement given to them the Gipsies would be inclined to live
in towns and villages like other people; and would in another
generation become civilised, and with the pains which are now
taken to educate the poor, and to diffuse the Scriptures and the
knowledge of Christ, would become a part of the regular
fold.&nbsp; It would require much patient continuance in well
doing in those who attempted it, and they must be prepared,
perhaps, to meet with some untowardness and much
disappointment.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Fraternicus&rdquo; sums up
the correspondence by suggesting a plan of taking the school to
the Gipsies instead of taking the Gipsies to the
schools:&mdash;&ldquo;If the compulsory education of the Gipsies
had taken place a century ago, and their tents brought under some
sort of sanitary inspection, what a change by this time would
have taken place in their habits,&rdquo; &amp;c.; and he further
says:&mdash;&ldquo;By degrees they might be brought to attend
divine worship; and if in the parish of a pious clergyman he
would probably embrace the opportunity of teaching them.&nbsp;
Much might be done by a pious schoolmaster and schoolmistress, by
whom the girls might be taught different kinds of work, knitting,
sewing, &amp;c.&nbsp; Should these suggestions be deemed worthy
of your insertion, they might, perhaps, awaken the attention of
some benevolent persons, whose superior talents and experience in
the ways of beneficence would enable them to perfect and carry
into execution a plan for the effectual benefit of these unhappy
portioners of our kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Junius,&rdquo; in the <i>Northampton Mercury</i>, under
date June 27th, 1814, writes:&mdash;&ldquo;When we consider the
immense sums raised for every probable means of doing good which
have <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>hitherto been made public, we cannot
doubt if a proper method should be proposed for the relief and
ameliorating the state of these people it would meet with
deserved encouragement.&nbsp; Suppose that legislature should
think this not unworthy its notice, and as a part of the great
family they ought not to be overlooked.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another
correspondent to the same Journal, &ldquo;A Friend of
Religion,&rdquo; writes under date July 21st, 1815, urging the
necessity of some means being adopted for their improvement, and
remarks as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Thousands of our
fellow-creatures would be raised from depravity and wretchedness
to a state of comfort; the private property of individuals be
much more secure, and the public materially benefited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of putting into practice measures for their
improvement, and the State taking hold of them by the hand as
children belonging to us, and with us, and for whom our first
care ought to have been, we have said in anger&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;Heathen
dog!<br />
Begone, begone! you shall have nothing here.&rsquo;<br />
The Indian turned; then facing Collingrew,<br />
In accents low and musical, he said:<br />
&lsquo;But I am very hungry; it is long<br />
Since I have eaten.&nbsp; Only give me a crust,<br />
A bone, to cheer me on my weary way.&rsquo;<br />
Then answered he, with fury and a frown:<br />

I&rsquo;ve nothing for you.&nbsp; Get you gone, I
say!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the summer of 1814, Mr. John Hoyland, of Sheffield, set
to work in earnest to try to improve the condition of the
Gipsies, and for that purpose he visited, in conjuction with Mr.
Allen, solicitor at Higham Ferners, many parts of
Northamptonshire and neighbouring counties; and he also sent out
a circular to most of the sheriffs in England with a number of
questions upon it relating to their numbers, condition, &amp;c.,
and the following are a few of the answers sent in
reply:&mdash;1. All Gipsies suppose the <!-- page 160--><a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>first of
them came from Egypt.&nbsp; 2. They cannot form any idea of the
number in England.&nbsp; 5. The more common names are Smith,
Cooper, Draper, Taylor, Boswell, Lee, Lovell, Leversedge, Allen,
Mansfield, Glover, Williams, Carew, Martin, Stanley, Buckley,
Plunkett, and Corrie.&nbsp; 6 and 7. The gangs in different towns
have not any connection or organisation.&nbsp; 8. In the county
of Herts it is computed there may be sixty families, having many
children.&nbsp; Whether they are quite so numerous in
Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, and Northamptonshire the answers
are not sufficiently definite to determine.&nbsp; In
Cambridgeshire, Oxfordshire, Warwickshire, Wiltshire, and
Dorsetshire, greater numbers are calculated upon.&nbsp; 9. More
than half their numbers follow no business; others are dealers in
horses and asses, &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; 10. Children are brought
up in the habits of their parents, particular to music and
dancing, and are of dissolute conduct.&nbsp; 11. The women mostly
carry baskets with trinkets and small wares, and tell
fortunes.&nbsp; 13. In most counties there are particular
situations to which they are partial.&nbsp; 15, 16, and 17. Do
not know of any person that can write the language, or of any
written specimen of it.&nbsp; 19. Those who profess any religion
represent it to be that of the country in which they reside; but
their description of it seldom goes beyond repeating the
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, and only a few of them are capable of
that.&nbsp; 20. They marry, for the most part, by pledging to
each other, without any ceremony.&nbsp; 21. They do not teach
their children religion.&nbsp; 22 and 23. Not <i>one in a
thousand can read</i>.&nbsp; Most of these answers were confirmed
by Riley Smith, who, during many years, was accounted the chief
of the Gipsies in Northamptonshire.&nbsp; Mr. John Forster and
Mr. William Carrington, respectable merchants of Biggleswade, and
who knew Riley Smith well, corroborated his statements.&nbsp;
After Hoyland had published his book no one stepped into the
breach, with flag in hand, to take up the cry; and for several
years&mdash;except the efforts of a clergyman here and
there&mdash;the interest in the cause of the <!-- page 161--><a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>Gipsies
dwindled down, and became gradually and miserably less, and the
consequence was the Gipsies have not improved an iota during the
three centuries they have been in our midst.&nbsp; As they were,
so they are, and likely to remain unless brought under State
control.</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;On
the winds<br />
A voice came murmuring, &lsquo;We must work and wait&rsquo;;<br

And every echo in the far-off fen<br />
Took up the utterance: &lsquo;We must work and wait.&rsquo;<br />
Her spirit felt it, &lsquo;We must work and
wait.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>No one heeded the warning.&nbsp; No one listened to the cries
of the poor Gipsy children as they glided into eternity.&nbsp; No
one put out their hands to save them as they kept disappearing
from the gaze of the bystanders, among whom were artificial
Christians, statesmen, and philanthropists.&nbsp; All was as
still as death, and the poor black wretches passed away.</p>
<p>Whether His Majesty George III. had ever read
Grellmann&rsquo;s or Hoyland&rsquo;s works on Gipsies has not
been shown.&nbsp; The following interesting account will show
that royal personages are not deaf to the cries of suffering
humanity, be it in a Gipsy&rsquo;s wigwam, a cottage, or
palace.&nbsp; It is taken from a missionary magazine for June,
1823, and in all probability the circumstance took place not many
years prior to this date, and is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;A king
of England of happy memory, who loved his people and his God
better than kings in general are wont to do, occasionally took
the exercise of hunting.&nbsp; Being out one day for this
purpose, the chase lay through the shrubs of the forest.&nbsp;
The stag had been hard run; and, to escape the dogs, had crossed
the river in a deep part.&nbsp; As the dogs could not be brought
to follow, it became necessary, in order to come up with it, to
make a circuitous route along the banks of the river, through
some thick and troublesome underwood.&nbsp; The roughness of <!--
page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>the ground, the long grass and frequent thickets, gave
opportunity for the sportsmen to separate from each other, each
one endeavouring to make the best and speediest route he
could.&nbsp; Before they had reached the end of the forest the
king&rsquo;s horse manifested signs of fatigue and uneasiness, so
much so that his Majesty resolved upon yielding the pleasures of
the chase to those of compassion for his horse.&nbsp; With this
view he turned down the first avenue in the forest and determined
on riding gently to the oaks, there to wait for some of his
attendants.&nbsp; His Majesty had only proceeded a few yards
when, instead of the cry of the hounds, he fancied he heard the
cry of human distress.&nbsp; As he rode forward he heard it more
distinctly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, my mother! my mother!&nbsp; God pity
and bless my poor mother!&rsquo;&nbsp; The curiosity and kindness
of the king led him instantly to the spot.&nbsp; It was a little
green plot on one side of the forest, where was spread on the
grass, under a branching oak, a little pallet, half covered with
a kind of tent, and a basket or two, with some packs, lay on the
ground at a few paces distant from the tent.&nbsp; Near to the
root of the tree he observed a little swarthy girl, about eight
years of age, on her knees, praying, while her little black eyes
ran down with tears.&nbsp; Distress of any kind was always
relieved by his Majesty, for he had a heart which melted at
&lsquo;human woe&rsquo;; nor was it unaffected on this
occasion.&nbsp; And now he inquired, &lsquo;What, my child, is
the cause of your weeping?&nbsp; For what do you
pray?&rsquo;&nbsp; The little creature at first started, then
rose from her knees, and pointing to the tent, said, &lsquo;Oh,
sir! my dying mother!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What?&rsquo; said his
Majesty, dismounting, and fastening his horse up to the branches
of the oak, &lsquo;what, my child? tell me all about
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; The little creature now led the king to the
tent; there lay, partly covered, a middle-aged female Gipsy in
the last stages of a decline, and in the last moments of
life.&nbsp; She turned her dying eyes expressively to the royal
visitor, then looked up to heaven; but not a word did she utter;
the organs of <!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>speech had ceased their office!
<i>the silver cord was loosed</i>, <i>and the wheel broken at the
cistern</i>.&nbsp; The little girl then wept aloud, and, stooping
down, wiped the dying sweat from her mother&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;
The king, much affected, asked the child her name, and of her
family; and how long her mother had been ill.&nbsp; Just at that
moment another Gipsy girl, much older, came, out of breath, to
the spot.&nbsp; She had been at the town of W---, and had brought
some medicine for her dying mother.&nbsp; Observing a stranger,
she modestly curtsied, and, hastening to her mother, knelt down
by her side, kissed her pallid lips, and burst into tears.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What, my dear child,&rsquo; said his Majesty, &lsquo;can
be done for you?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, sir!&rsquo; she replied,
&lsquo;my dying mother wanted a religious person to teach her and
to pray with her before she died.&nbsp; I ran all the way before
it was light this morning to W---, and asked for a minister,
<i>but no one could I get to come with me to pray with my dear
mother</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; The dying woman seemed sensible of what
her daughter was saying, and her countenance was much
agitated.&nbsp; The air was again rent with the cries of the
distressed daughters.&nbsp; The king, full of kindness, instantly
endeavoured to comfort them.&nbsp; He said, &lsquo;I am a
minister, and God has sent me to instruct and comfort your
mother.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then sat down on a pack by the side of
the pallet, and, taking the hand of the dying Gipsy, discoursed
on the demerit of sin and the nature of redemption.&nbsp; He then
pointed her to Christ, the all-sufficient Saviour.&nbsp; While
the king was doing this the poor creature seemed to gather
consolation and hope; her eyes sparkled with brightness, and her
countenance became animated.&nbsp; She looked up; she smiled; but
it was the last smile; it was the glimmering of expiring
nature.&nbsp; As the expression of peace, however, remained
strong in her countenance, it was not till some little time had
elapsed that they perceived the struggling spirit had left
mortality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was at this moment that some of his Majesty&rsquo;s
attendants, who had missed him at the chase, and who had <!--
page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>been riding through the forest in search of him, rode
up, and found the king comforting the afflicted Gipsies.&nbsp; It
was an affecting sight, and worthy of everlasting record in the
annals of kings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Majesty now rose up, put some gold into the hands
of the afflicted girls, promised them his protection, and bade
them look to heaven.&nbsp; He then wiped the tears from his eyes
and mounted his horse.&nbsp; His attendants, greatly affected,
stood in silent admiration.&nbsp; Lord L--- was now going to
speak, when his Majesty, turning to the Gipsies, and pointing to
the breathless corpse, and to the weeping girls, said, with
strong emotion, &lsquo;Who, my lord, who, thinkest thou, was
neighbour unto these?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hark!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you hear the
rumbling of its wheels?<br />
Nearer it comes and nearer!&nbsp; Oh, what light!<br />
The tent is full; &rsquo;tis glory everywhere!<br />
Dear Jesus, I am coming!&nbsp; Then she fell&mdash;<br />
As falls a meteor when the skies are clear.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this solemn but interesting event nothing further seems
to have been done by either Christian or philanthropist towards
wiping out this national disgrace, and the Gipsies were left to
follow the bent of their evil propensities for several years,
till Mr. Crabb&rsquo;s reading of Hoyland and witnessing the
sentence of death passed upon a Gipsy at Winchester, in 1827, for
horse-stealing.</p>
<p>Mr. Crabb happened to enter just as the judge was passing
sentence of death on two unhappy men.&nbsp; To one he held out
the hope of mercy; but to the other, a poor Gipsy, who was
convicted of horse-stealing, he said, no hope could be
given.&nbsp; The young man, for he was but a youth, immediately
fell on his knees, and with uplifted hands and eyes, apparently
unconscious of any persons being present but the judge and
himself, addressed him as follows: &ldquo;Oh, my Lord, save my
life!&rdquo;&nbsp; The judge replied, &ldquo;No; you can have no
mercy in this world: I and my brother judges <!-- page 165--><a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>have come
to the determination to execute horse-stealers, especially
Gipsies, because of the increase of the crime.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
suppliant, still on his knees, entreated&mdash;&ldquo;Do, my Lord
Judge, save my life! do, for God&rsquo;s sake, for my
wife&rsquo;s sake, for my baby&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the judge, &ldquo;I cannot; you should
have thought of your wife and children before.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
then ordered him to be taken away, and the poor fellow was rudely
dragged from his earthly judge.&nbsp; It is hoped, as a penitent
sinner, he obtained the more needful mercy of God, through the
abounding grace of Christ.&nbsp; After this scene Mr. Crabb could
not remain in court.&nbsp; As he returned he found the mournful
intelligence had been communicated to some Gipsies who had been
waiting without, anxious to learn the fate of their
companion.&nbsp; They seemed distracted.</p>
<p>On the outside of the court, seated on the ground, appeared an
old woman and a very young one, and with them two children, the
eldest three years and the other an infant but fourteen days
old.&nbsp; The former sat by its mother&rsquo;s side, alike
unconscious of her bitter agonies and of her father&rsquo;s
despair.&nbsp; The old woman held the infant tenderly in her
arms, and endeavoured to comfort its weeping mother, soon to be a
widow under circumstances the most melancholy.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
dear, don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;remember you have
this dear little baby.&rdquo;&nbsp; Impelled by the sympathies of
pity and a sense of duty, Mr. Crabb spoke to them on the evil of
sin, and expressed his hope that the melancholy event would prove
a warning to them, and to all their people.&nbsp; The poor man
was executed about a fortnight after his condemnation.</p>
<p>Mr. Crabb being full of fire and zeal, set to work in right
good earnest, and succeeded in forming a committee at Southampton
to bring about a reformation among the Gipsies.&nbsp; He also
enlisted the sympathy of other earnest Christians in the work,
and for a time, while the sun shone, received encouraging signs
of success, in fact, according to his little work published in
1831, his labours were attended with blessed results among the
adult portion of the Gipsies.&nbsp; <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>Owing to
the wandering habits of the Gipsies, discouragements, and his own
death, the work, so far as any organisation was concerned, came
to an end.&nbsp; No Elisha came forward to catch his mantle, the
consequence was the Gipsies were left again to work out their own
destruction according to their own inclinations and tastes, as
they deemed best, plainly showing that voluntary efforts are very
little better than a shadow, vanishing smoke, and spent steam, to
illuminate, elevate, warm, cheer, and encourage the wandering,
dark-eyed vagabonds roving about in our midst into paths of
usefulness, honesty, and sobriety.</p>
<p>Thus far in this part I have feebly endeavoured to show that
rigid, stern, inflexible law and justice on the one hand, and
meek, quiet, mild, human love and mercy on the other hand, have
separately failed in the object the promoters had in view.&nbsp;
Justice tried to exterminate the Gipsy; mercy tried to win them
over.&nbsp; Of the two processes I would much prefer that of
mercy.&nbsp; It is more pleasant to human nature to be under its
influence, and more in the character of an Englishman to deal out
mercy.&nbsp; The next efforts put forth to reform these renegades
was by means of fiction, romance, and poetry.&nbsp; Some writers,
in their praiseworthy endeavours to make up a medicine to improve
the condition of the Gipsies, have neutralised its effects by
adding too much honey and spice to it.&nbsp; Others, who have
mistaken the emaciated condition of the Gipsy, have been dosing
him with cordials entirely, to such a degree, that
he&mdash;Romany <i>chal</i>&mdash;imagines he is right in
everything he says and does, and he ought to have perfect liberty
to go anywhere or do anything.&nbsp; Some have attempted to paint
him white, and in doing so have worked up the blackness from
underneath, and presented to us a character which excites a
feeling in our notions&mdash;a kind of go-between, akin to
sympathy and disgust.&nbsp; Not a few have thrown round the Gipsy
an enchanting, bewitching halo, which an inspection has proved
nothing less than a delusion and a snare.&nbsp; Others have tried
to improve this <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>field of thistles and sour docks by
throwing a handful of daisy seeds among them.&nbsp; It requires
something more than a phantom life-boat to rescue the Gipsy and
bring him to land.&nbsp; Scents and perfumes in a death-bed
chamber only last for a short time.&nbsp; A bottle of rose-water
thrown into a room where decomposition is at work upon a body
will not restore life.&nbsp; Scattering flowers upon a cesspool
of iniquity will not purify it.&nbsp; A fictitious rope composed
of beautiful ideas is not the thing to save drowning Gipsy
children.&nbsp; To put artificially-coloured feathers upon the
head of a Gipsy child dressed in rags and shreds, with his body
literally teeming with vermin and filth, will not make him
presentable at court or a fit subject for a drawing-room.&nbsp;
To dress the Satanic, demon-looking face of a Gipsy with the
violet-powder of imagery only temporally hides from view the
repulsive aspect of his features.&nbsp; The first storm of
persecution brings him out again in his true colour.&nbsp; The
forked light of imagination thrown across the heavens on a dark
night is not the best to reveal the character of a Gipsy and set
him upon the highways for usefulness and heaven.&nbsp; The
dramatist has strutted the Gipsy across the stage in various
characters in his endeavour to improve his condition.&nbsp; After
the fine colours have been doffed, music finished, applause
ceased, curtain dropped, and scene ended, he has been a black,
swarthy, idle, thieving, lying, blackguard of a Gipsy
still.&nbsp; Applause, fine colours, and dazzling lights have not
altered his nature.&nbsp; Bad he is, and bad he will remain,
unless we follow out the advice of the good old book,
&ldquo;Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is
old he will not depart from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would to God the voice of the little Gipsy girl would begin to
ring in our ears, when she spoke with finger pointed and tears in
her eyes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is a cabin half-way down the
cliff,<br />

</blockquote>
<p>The word &ldquo;Gipsy&rdquo; seems to have a magic thread
running through it, beginning at the tip end of &ldquo;G&rdquo;
and ending with the tail end of &ldquo;y.&rdquo;&nbsp; Geese have
tried to gobble it, ducks swallow it, hens scratched after it,
peacocks pecked it, dandy cocks crowed over it, foxes have hid
it, dogs have fought for it, cats have sworn and spit over it,
pigs have tried to gulp it as the daintiest morsel, parrots have
chatted about it, hawks, eagles, jackdaws, magpies, ravens, and
crows have tried to carry it away as a precious jewel, and in the
end all have put it down as a thing they could neither carry nor
swallow; and after all, when it has been stripped of its dowdy
colours, what has it been?&nbsp; Only a &ldquo;scamp,&rdquo; in
many cases, reared and fostered among thieves, pickpockets, and
blackguards, in our back slums and sink gutters.&nbsp; Strip the
20,000 men, women, and children of the word &ldquo;Gipsy,&rdquo;
moving about our country under the artificial and unreal
association connected with Gipsy life, so-called, of the
&ldquo;red cloaks,&rdquo; &ldquo;silver buttons,&rdquo;
&ldquo;pretty little feet,&rdquo; &ldquo;small hands,&rdquo;
&ldquo;bewitching eyes,&rdquo; &ldquo;long black hair,&rdquo; in
nine cases out of ten in name only, and you, at a glance, see the
class of people you have been neglecting, consequently sending to
ruin and misery through fear on the one hand and lavishing smiles
on the other.</p>
<p>In all ages there have been people silly enough to be led away
by sights, sounds, colours, and unrealities, to follow a course
of life for which they are not suited, either by education,
position, or tastes.&nbsp; No one acts the part of a butterfly
among school-boys better than the black-eyed Gipsy girl has <!--
page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>done among &ldquo;fast-goers,&rdquo; swells, and
fops.&nbsp; In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred she has trotted
them out to perfection and then left them in the lurch, and
those, when they have come to their senses, and had their eyes
opened to the stern facts of a Gipsy&rsquo;s life, have said to
themselves, &ldquo;What fools we have been, to be sure,&rdquo;
and they would have given any amount to have undone the
past.&nbsp; The praise, flattery, and looks bestowed upon the
&ldquo;bewitching deceivers,&rdquo; when they have been labouring
under the sense of infatuation and fascination instead of reason,
has made them in the presence of friends hang down their heads
like a willow, and to escape, if possible, the company of their
&ldquo;old chums&rdquo; by all sorts of man&oelig;uvres.&nbsp;
Hubert Petalengro&mdash;a gentleman, and a rich member of a long
family&mdash;conceived the idea, after falling madly in love with
a dark-eyed beauty, so-called, of turning Gipsy and tasting for
himself&mdash;not in fiction and romance&mdash;the charms of tent
life, as he thought, in reality passing through the
&ldquo;first,&rdquo; &ldquo;second,&rdquo; and &ldquo;third
degrees.&rdquo;&nbsp; At first, it was ideal and fascinating
enough in all conscience; it was a pity Brother Petalengro did
not have a foretaste of it by spending a month in a Gipsy&rsquo;s
tent in the depth of winter, with no balance at his
banker&rsquo;s, and compelled to wear Gipsy clothing, and make
pegs and skewers for his Sunday broth; gather sticks for the
fire, and sleep on damp straw in the midst of slush and snow, and
peeping through the ragged tent roof at the moon as he lay on his
back, surrounded by Gipsies of both sexes, of all ages and sizes,
cursing each other under the maddening influence of brandy and
disappointment.&nbsp; To make himself and his damsel comfortable
on a Gipsy tour he fills his pocket with gold, flask with brandy,
buys a quantity of rugs upon which are a number of foxes&rsquo;
heads&mdash;and I suppose tails too&mdash;waterproof covering for
the tent, and waterproof sheets and a number of blankets to lay
on the damp grass to prevent their tender bodies being overtaken
with rheumatics, and he also lays in a stock of potted meats and
other dainties; makes <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span

Esmeralda and her two brothers and the donkeys; takes first and
second-class tickets for the whole of them to Hull&mdash;the
Balaams excepted (it is not on record that they spoke to him on
his journey); provides Esmeralda with dresses and
petticoats&mdash;not too long to hide her pretty ankles, red
stockings, and her lovely little foot&mdash;gold and diamond
rings, violin, tambourine, the guitar, Wellington boots, and
starts upon his trip to Norway in the midst of summer
beauty.&nbsp; Many times he must have said to himself, &ldquo;Oh!
how delightful.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;As we journeyed onward, how
fragrant the wild flowers&mdash;those wild flowers can never be
forgotten.&nbsp; Gipsies like flowers, it is part of their
nature.&nbsp; Esmeralda would pluck them, and forming a charming
bouquet, interspersed with beautiful wild roses, her first
thoughts are to pin them in the button-hole of the Romany Rye
(Gipsy gentleman).&nbsp; As we journeyed quietly through the
forest, how delightful its scenes.&nbsp; Free from all care, we
enjoy the anticipation of a long and pleasant ramble in
Norway&rsquo;s happy land.&nbsp; We felt contented with all
things, and thankful that we should be so permitted to roam with
our tents and wild children of nature in keeping the solitudes we
sought.&nbsp; The rain had soon ceased, tinkle, tinkle went the
hawk-bells on the collar of our Bura Rawnee as she led the way
along the romantic Norwegian road.</p>

of the Romany Rye (Gipsy gentleman) and as she proudly paced
along in her heavy boots, she pictured in imagery the pleasant
life she should lead as her Romany Rye&rsquo;s joovel, monshi, or
somi.&nbsp; She was full of fun, yet there was nothing in her
fanciful delineations which could offend us.&nbsp; They were but
the foam of a crested wave, soon dissipated in the air.&nbsp;

class="pagenum">p. 171</span>wild notes trilled by the bird of
the forest.&nbsp; We came again into the open valley.&nbsp; Down
a meadow gushed a small streamlet which splashed from a wooden
spout on to the roadside.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The spot where we
pitched our tents was near a sort of small natural terrace, at
the summit of a steep slope above the road, backed by a mossy
bank, shaded by brushwood and skirting the dense foliage of the
dark forest of pine and fir, above our camp.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;We gave two of the peasants some brandy and
tobacco.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then all our visitors left, except
four interesting young peasant girls, who still
lingered.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They had all pleasant
voices.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We listened to them with much
pleasure; there was so much sweetness and feeling in their
melody.&nbsp; Zachariah made up for his brother&rsquo;s
timidity.&nbsp; Full of fun, what dreadful faces the young Gipsy
would pull, they were absolutely frightful; then he would twist
and turn his body into all sorts of serpentine contortions.&nbsp;
If spoken to he would suddenly, with a hop, skip, and a jump
alight in his tent as if he had tumbled from the sky, and,
sitting bolt upright, make a hideous face till his mouth nearly
stretched from ear to ear, while his dark eyes sparkled with wild
excitement, he would sing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dawdy!&nbsp; Dawdy! dit a kei<br />
Rockerony, fake your bosh!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;At one time a woman brought an exceedingly fat child
for us to look at, and she wanted Esmeralda to suckle it, which
was, of course, hastily declined.&nbsp; We began to ask ourselves
if this was forest seclusion.&nbsp; Still our visitors were kind,
good-humoured people, and some drank our brandy, and some smoked
our English tobacco.&nbsp; After our tea, at five o&rsquo;clock,
we had a pleasant stroll.&nbsp; Once more we were with
Nature.&nbsp; There we lingered till the scenes round us, in
their vivid beauty, seemed graven deep in our thought.&nbsp; How
graphic are the lines of Moore:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The turf shall be my fragrant
shrine,<br />
My temple, Lord, that arch of Thine,<br />
My censor&rsquo;s breath the mountain airs,<br />
And silent thoughts my only prayers.</p>
<p><!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;My choir shall be the moonlight waves,<br
/>
When murm&rsquo;ring homeward to their caves,<br />
Or when the stillness of the sea<br />
Even more of music breathes of Thee!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How appropriate were the words of the great poet to our
feelings.&nbsp; We went and sat down.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;As we
were seated by our camp fire, a tall, old man, looking round our
tents, came and stood contemplating us at our tea.&nbsp; He
looked as if he thought we were enjoying a life of
happiness.&nbsp; Nor was he wrong.&nbsp; He viewed us with a
pleased and kindly expression, as he seemed half lost in
contemplation.&nbsp; We sent for the flask of brandy.&nbsp;
Returning to our tents we put on our Napoleon boots and made some
additions to our toilette.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course, kind Mr.
Petalengro would assist lovely Esmeralda with hers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whilst we were engaged some women came to our tents.&nbsp;
The curiosity of the sex was exemplified, for they were dying to
look behind the tent partition which screened us from
observation.&nbsp; We did not know what they expected to see;
one, bolder than the rest, could not resist the desire to look
behind the scenes, and hastily drew back and dropped the curtain,
when we said rather sharply, &lsquo;Nei! nei!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Esmeralda shortly afterwards appeared in her blue dress and
silver buttons.&nbsp; Then we all seated ourselves on a mossy
bank, on the side of the terrace, with a charming view across the
valley of the Logan.&nbsp; At eight o&rsquo;clock the music
commenced.&nbsp; The sun shone beautifully, and the mosquitoes
and midges bit right and left with hungry determination.&nbsp; We
sat in a line on the soft mossy turf of the grassy slope,
sheltered by foliage.&nbsp; Esmeralda and Noah with their
tambourines, myself with the castanets, and Zachariah with his
violin.&nbsp; Some peasant women and girls came up after we had
played a short time.&nbsp; It was a curious scene.&nbsp; Our
tents were pleasantly situated on an open patch of green sward,
surrounded by border thickets, near the sunny bank and the small
flat terrace.&nbsp; The rising hills and rugged ravines on the
other side of the valley all gave a singular and <!-- page
173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>romantic beauty to the lovely view.&nbsp; Although our
Gipsies played with much spirit until nine o&rsquo;clock, none of
the peasants would dance.&nbsp; At nine o&rsquo;clock our music
ceased, and we all retired to our tents with the intention of
going to bed.&nbsp; When we were going into our tents, a peasant
and several others with him, who had just arrived, asked us to
play again.&nbsp; At length, observing several peasant girls were
much disappointed, we decided to play once more.&nbsp; It was
past nine o&rsquo;clock when we again took up our position on the
mossy bank; so we danced, and the peasant girls, until nearly ten
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Once we nearly whirled ourself and Esmeralda
over the slope into the road below.&nbsp; Esmeralda&rsquo;s dark
eyes flashed fire and sparkled with merriment and
witchery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bacon and fish at dinner were excellent; we hardly
knew which was best.&nbsp; A peasant boy brought us a bundle of
sticks for our fire.&nbsp; The sun became exceedingly hot.&nbsp;
Esmeralda and myself went and sat in some shade near our
tents.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Noah stood in the shade blacking his
boots, and observed to Esmeralda, &lsquo;I shall not help my wife
as Mr. Petalengro does you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said
Esmeralda, &lsquo;what is a wife for?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;For!&rsquo; retorted Noah, sharply, giving his boot an
extra brush, &lsquo;why, to wait upon her husband.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;And what,&rsquo; said Esmeralda, &lsquo;is a husband
for?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s a husband for!&rsquo;
exclaimed Noah, with a look of profound pity for his
sister&rsquo;s ignorance, &lsquo;why, to eat and drink, and look
on.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Petalengro goes on to say: &ldquo;It
would seem to us that the more rude energy a man has in his
composition the more a woman will be made to take her position as
helpmate.&nbsp; It is always a mark of great civilisation and the
effeminacy of a people when women obtain the undue mastery of
men.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he farther goes on to say: &ldquo;We were
just having a romp with Esmeralda and her two brothers as we were
packing up our things, and a merry laugh, when some men appeared
at the fence near our camping-ground.&nbsp; We little
think,&rdquo; says Mr. Petalengro, &ldquo;how much we can do in
this world to lighten a lonely wayfarer&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>

174</span>Esmeralda and Mr. Petalengro tell each other their
fortunes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Esmeralda and myself were sitting in our
tents.&nbsp; Then the thought occurred to her that we should tell
her fortune.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your fortune must be a good one,&rsquo;
said we, laughing; &lsquo;let me see your hand and your lines of
life.&rsquo;&nbsp; We shall never forget Esmeralda.&nbsp; She
looked so earnestly as we regarded attentively the line of her
open hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Mr. Petalengro does not say that tears
were to be seen trickling down those lovely cheeks of Esmeralda
while this fortune-telling, nonsensical farce was being played
out.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Then we took her step by step through some
scenes of her supposed future.&nbsp; We did not tell all.&nbsp;
The rest was reserved for another day.&nbsp; There was a serious
look on her countenance as we ended; but, reader, such secrets
should not be revealed.&nbsp; Esmeralda commenced to tell our
fortunes.&nbsp; We were interested to know what she would
say.&nbsp; We cast ourselves on the waves of fate.&nbsp; The
Gipsy raised her dark eyes from our hand as she looked earnestly
in the face.&nbsp; You are a young gentleman of good
connections.&nbsp; Many lands you have seen.&nbsp; But, young
man, something tells me you are of a wavering
disposition.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; And then charming Esmeralda
would strike up &ldquo;The Little Gipsy&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s the King of the Gipsies,
that&rsquo;s true,<br />
My mother she learned me some camping to do;<br />
With a packel on my back, and they all wish me well,<br />
I started up to London some fortunes for to tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was a walking up fair London streets,<br />
Two handsome young squires I chanced for to meet,<br />
They viewed my brown cheeks, and they liked them so well,<br />
They said &lsquo;My little Gipsy girl, can you my fortune
tell?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh yes! kind Sir, give me hold of your hand,<br
/>
For you have got honours, both riches and land;<br />
Of all the pretty maidens you must lay aside,<br />
For it is the little Gipsy girl that is to be your
bride.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

deep I&rsquo;m sure,<br />
Where I&rsquo;d servants for to wait on me, and open me the
door;<br />
A rich bed of down to lay my head upon&mdash;<br />
In less than nine months after I could his fortune tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once I was a Gipsy girl, but now a squire&rsquo;s
bride,<br />
I&rsquo;ve servants for to wait on me, and in my carriage
ride.<br />
The bells shall ring so merrily, sweet music they shall play,<br
/>
And will crown the glad tidings of that lucky, lucky
day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The drawback to this evening&rsquo;s whirligig farce was that
the mosquitoes determined to come in for a share.&nbsp; These
little, nipping, biting creatures preferred settling upon young
blood, full of life and activity, existing under artificial
circumstances, to the carcase of a dead horse lying in the
knacker&rsquo;s yard.&nbsp; To prevent these little stingers
drawing the sap of life from the sweet bodies of these pretty,
innocent, lovable creatures, the Gipsies acted a very cruel part
in dressing their faces over with a brown liquid, called the
&ldquo;tincture of cedar.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not stated whether
the &ldquo;tincture of cedar &ldquo;was made in Shropshire or
Lebanon, nor whether it was extracted from roses, or a decoction
of thistles.&nbsp; Alas, alas! how fickle human life is!&nbsp;
How often we say and do things in jest and fun which turn out to
be stern realities in another form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we looked upon the church and parsonage, surrounded
as they were by the modern park, with the broad silver lake near,
the rising mountains on all sides, and the clear blue sky above,
our senses seemed entranced with the passing beauty of the
scene.&nbsp; It was one of those glimpses of perfect nature which
casts the anchor deep in memory, and leaves a lasting impression
of bygone days.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then Esmeralda danced as she
sang the words of her song; the words not in English are her own,
for I cannot find them even in the slang Romany, and what she
meant by her bosh is only known to herself.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Shula gang shaugh gig a magala,<br />
I&rsquo;ll set me down on yonder hill;<br />
And there I&rsquo;ll cry my fill,<br />
And every tear shall turn a mill.<br />

</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We were supremely happy,&rdquo; says Mr. Petalengro,
&ldquo;in our wandering existence.&nbsp; We contrasted in our
semi-consciousness of mind our absence from a thousand anxious
cares which crowd upon the social position of those who take part
in an overwrought state of extreme civilisation.&nbsp; How long
we should have continued our half-dormant reflections which might
have added a few more notes upon the philosophy of life, we knew
not, but we were roused by the rumble of a stolk-jaerre along the
road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the dance no music can be better than that of a
Gipsy band; there is life and animation in it which carries you
away.&nbsp; If you have danced to it yourself, especially in a
<i>czardas,</i> <a name="citation176"></a><a href="#footnote176"

Nothing but leaves!&rdquo;</p>

<p>George Borrow, during his labours among the Gipsies of Spain
forty years ago, did not find much occasion for rollicking fun,
merriment, and boisterous laughter; his path was not one of
roses, over mossy banks, among the honeysuckles and daisies, by
the side of running rivulets warbling over the smooth pebbles;
sitting among the primroses, listening to the enchanting voices
of the thousand forest and valley songsters; gazing at the
various and beautiful kinds of foliage on the hill-sides as the
thrilling strains of music pealed forth from the sweet voice of
Esmeralda and her tambourine.&nbsp; No, no, no!&nbsp; George
Borrow had to face the hard lot of all those who start on the
path of usefulness, honour, and heaven.&nbsp; Hard fare,
disappointment, opposition, few friends, life in danger, his path
was rough and covered with stones; his flowers were thistles, his
songs attended with tears, and sorrow filled his heart.&nbsp; But
note his object, and mark his end.&nbsp; In speaking of some of
the difficulties in his travels, he says:&mdash;&ldquo;My time
lay heavily on my hands, my only source of amusement consisting
in the conversation of the woman telling of the wonderful tales
of the land of the Moors&mdash;prison escapes, thievish feats,
and one or two poisoning adventures in which she had been
engaged.&nbsp; There was something very wild in her
gestures.&nbsp; She goggled frightfully with her
eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then <!-- page 178--><a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>speaking of
the old Gipsy woman whom he went to see:&mdash;&ldquo;Here,
thrusting her hand into her pocket, she discharged a handful of
some kind of dust or snuff into the fellow&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; He
stamped and roared, but was for some time held fast by the two
Gipsy men; he extricated himself, however, and attempted to
unsheath a knife which he wore in his girdle; but the two young
Gipsies flung themselves upon him like furies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow says, after travelling a long distance by night, and
setting out again the next morning to travel thirteen
leagues:&mdash;&ldquo;Throughout the day a drizzling rain was
falling, which turned the dust of the roads into mud and
mire.&nbsp; Towards evening we reached a moor&mdash;a wild place
enough, strewn with enormous stones and rocks.&nbsp; The wind had
ceased, but a strong wind rose and howled at our backs.&nbsp; The
sun went down, and dark night presently came over us.&nbsp; We
proceeded for nearly three hours, until we heard the barking of
dogs, and perceived a light or two in the distance.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That is Trujillo,&rsquo; said Antonio, who had not spoken
for a long time.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am glad of it,&rsquo; I replied;
&lsquo;I am so thoroughly tired, I shall sleep soundly in
Trujillo.&rsquo;&nbsp; That is as it may be.&nbsp; We soon
entered the town, which appeared dark and gloomy enough.&nbsp; I
followed close behind the Gipsy, who led the way, I knew not
whither, through dismal streets and dark places where cats were
squalling.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here is the house,&rsquo; said he at
last, dismounting before a low, mean hut.&nbsp; He knocked, but
no answer.&nbsp; He knocked again, but no answer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There can be no difficulty,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;with
respect to what we have to do.&nbsp; If your friends are gone
out, it is easy enough to go to a posada.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You
know not what you say,&rsquo; replied the Gipsy.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
dare not go to the mesuna, nor enter any house in Trujillo save
this, and this is shut.&nbsp; Well, there is no remedy; we must
move on; and, between ourselves, the sooner we leave the place
the better.&nbsp; My own brother was garroted at
Trujillo.&rsquo;&nbsp; He lighted a cigar by means of a steel and
yesca, sprung on his <!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>mule, and proceeded through streets
and lanes equally dismal as those through which we had already
travelled.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Borrow goes on to say:&mdash;&ldquo;I
confess I did not much like this decision of the Gipsy; I felt
very slight inclination to leave the town behind, and to venture
into unknown places in the dark of the night, amidst rain and
mist&mdash;for the wind had now dropped, and the rain again began
to fall briskly.&nbsp; I was, moreover, much fatigued, and wished
for nothing better than to deposit myself in some comfortable
manger, where I might sink to sleep lulled by the pleasant sound
of horses and mules despatching their provender.&nbsp; I had,
however, put myself under the direction of the Gipsy, and I was
too old a traveller to quarrel with my guide under present
circumstances.&nbsp; I therefore followed close to his crupper,
our only light being the glow emitted from the Gipsy&rsquo;s
cigar.&nbsp; At last he flung it from his mouth into a puddle,
and we were then in darkness.&nbsp; We proceeded in this manner
for a long time.&nbsp; The Gipsy was silent.&nbsp; I myself was
equally so.&nbsp; The rain descended more and more.&nbsp; I
sometimes thought I heard doleful noises, something like the
hooting of owls.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is a strange night to be
wandering abroad in,&rsquo; I at length said to Antonio, the
Gipsy.&nbsp; (The Gipsy word for Antonio is
&lsquo;Devil.&rsquo;)&nbsp; &lsquo;It is, brother,&rsquo; said
the Gipsy; &lsquo;but I would sooner be abroad in such a night,
and in such places, than in the estaripel of Trujillo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wandered at least a league further, and now appeared
to be near a wood, for I could occasionally distinguish the
trunks of immense trees.&nbsp; Suddenly Antonio stopped his
mule.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look, brother,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;to the
left, and tell me if you do not see a light; your eyes are
sharper than mine.&rsquo;&nbsp; I did as he commanded me.&nbsp;
At first I could see nothing, but, moving a little further on, I
plainly saw a large light at some distance, seemingly amongst the
trees.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yonder cannot be a lamp or candle,&rsquo;
said I; &lsquo;it is more like the blaze of a fire.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Very likely,&rsquo; said Antonio.&nbsp; &lsquo;There are
no queres (<i>houses</i>) in this place; it is doubtless a fire
made by <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>durotunes (<i>shepherds</i>); let us
go and join them, for, as you say, it is doleful work wandering
about at night amidst rain and mire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We dismounted and entered what I now saw was a forest,
leading the animals cautiously amongst the trees and
brushwood.&nbsp; In about five minutes we reached a small open
space, at the farther side of which, at the foot of a large
cork-tree, a fire was burning, and by it stood or sat two or
three figures.&nbsp; They had heard our approach, and one of them
now exclaimed, &lsquo;Quien Vive?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I know that
voice,&rsquo; said Antonio, and, leaving the horse with me,
rapidly advanced towards the fire.&nbsp; Presently I heard an
&lsquo;Ola!&rsquo; and a laugh, and soon the voice of Antonio
summoned me to advance.&nbsp; On reaching the fire, I found two
dark lads, and a still darker woman of about forty, the latter
seated on what appeared to be horse or mule furniture.&nbsp; I
likewise saw a horse and two donkeys tethered to the neighbouring
trees.&nbsp; It was, in fact, a Gipsy bivouac . . . &lsquo;Come
forward, brother, and show yourself,&rsquo; said Antonio to me;
&lsquo;you are amongst friends; these are of the Errate, the very
people whom I expected to find at Trujillo, and in whose house we
should have slept.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;could have
induced them to leave their house in Trujillo and come into this
dark forest, in the midst of wind and rain, to pass the
night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They come on business of Egypt, brother,
doubtless,&rsquo; replied Antonio, &lsquo;and that business is
none of ours.&nbsp; Calla boca!&nbsp; It is lucky we have found
them here, else we should have had no supper, and our horses no
corn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My ro is prisoner at the village yonder,&rsquo;
said the woman, pointing with her hand in a particular direction;
&lsquo;he is prisoner yonder for choring a mailla (<i>stealing a
donkey</i>); we are come to see what we can do in his behalf; and
where can we lodge better than in this forest, where there is
nothing to pay?&nbsp; It is not the first time, I trow, that
Calor&eacute; have slept at the root of a tree.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>&ldquo;One of the striplings now gave us barley for our
animals in a large bag, into which we successively introduced
their heads, allowing the famished creatures to regale themselves
till we conceived that they had satisfied their hunger.&nbsp;
There was a puchero simmering at the fire, half-fall of bacon,
garbanzos, and other provisions; this was emptied into a large
wooden platter, and out of this Antonio and myself supped; the
other Gipsies refused to join us, giving us to understand that
they had eaten before our arrival; they all, however, did justice
to the leathern bottle of Antonio, which, before his departure
from Merida, he had the precaution to fill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was by this time completely overcome with fatigue and
sleep.&nbsp; Antonio flung me an immense horse-cloth, of which he
bore more than one beneath the huge cushion on which he
rode.&nbsp; In this I wrapped myself, and placing my head upon a
bundle, and my feet as near as possible to the fire, I lay
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How delightful and soul-inspiring it would have been to the
weary pilgrim, jaded in the cause of the poor Gipsies, if
Antonio&rsquo;s heart had been full of religious zeal and
fervour, and Hubert Petalengro and Esmeralda, their souls filled
to overflowing with the love of God, had been by the side of the
camp-fire, and the trio had struck up with their sweet voices, as
the good man was drawing his weary legs and cold feet together
before the embers of the dying Gipsy fire&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Guide me, O thou great
Jehovah,<br />

shield.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>&ldquo;Antonio and the other Gipsies remained seated by
the fire conversing.&nbsp; I listened for a moment to what they
said, but I did not perfectly understand it, and what I did
understand by no means interested me.&nbsp; The rain still
drizzled, but I heeded it not, and was soon asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sun was just appearing as I awoke.&nbsp; I made
several efforts before I could rise from the ground; my limbs
were quite stiff, and my hair was covered with rime, for the rain
had ceased, and a rather severe frost set in.&nbsp; I looked
around me, but could see neither Antonio nor the Gipsies; the
animals of the latter had likewise disappeared, so had the horse
which I had hitherto rode; the mule, however, of Antonio still
remained fastened to the tree.&nbsp; The latter circumstance
quieted some apprehensions which were beginning to arise in my
mind.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are gone on some business of
Egypt,&rsquo; I said to myself, &lsquo;and will return
anon.&rsquo;&nbsp; I gathered together the embers of the fire,
and heaping upon them sticks and branches, soon succeeded in
calling forth a blaze, beside which I again placed the puchero,
with what remained of the provision of last night.&nbsp; I waited
for a considerable time in expectation of the return of my
companions, but as they did not appear, I sat down and
breakfasted.&nbsp; Before I had well finished I heard the noise
of a horse approaching rapidly, and presently Antonio made his
appearance amongst the trees, with some agitation in his
countenance.&nbsp; He sprang from the horse, and instantly
proceeded to untie the mule.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mount, brother,
mount!&rsquo; said he, pointing to the horse; &lsquo;I went with
the Callee and her chab&eacute;s to the village where the ro is
in trouble; the chino-baro, however, seized them at once with
their cattle, and would have laid hands also on me; but I set
spurs to the grasti, gave him the bridle, and was soon far
away.&nbsp; Mount, brother, mount, or we shall have the whole
rustic <i>canaille</i> upon us in a twinkling&mdash;it is such a
bad place.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I almost imagine Borrow would have said, under the <!-- page

stirrup to mount his horse to fly for his life into the wild
regions of an unknown country:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jesus, lover of my soul,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Hangs my helpless soul on Thee,<br />
Leave, O leave me not alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still support and comfort me.<br />
All my trust on Thee is stayed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All my help from Thee I bring,<br />
Cover my defenceless head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the shadow of Thy wing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sir Walter Scott, in &ldquo;Guy Mannering,&rdquo; speaking of
the dark deeds of the Gipsies, says:&mdash;&ldquo;The idea of
being dragged out of his miserable concealment by wretches whose
trade was that of midnight murder, without weapons or the
slightest means of defence, except entreaties which would be only
their sport, and cries for help which could never reach other ear
than their own&mdash;his safety intrusted to the precarious
compassion of a being associated with these felons, and whose
trade of rapine and imposture must have hardened her against
every human feeling&mdash;the bitterness of his emotions almost
choked him.&nbsp; He endeavoured to read in her withered and dark
countenance, as the lamp threw its light upon her features,
something that promised those feelings of compassion which
females, even in their most degraded state, can seldom altogether
smother.&nbsp; There was no such touch of humanity about this
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never fear,&rsquo; said the old Gipsy man,
&lsquo;Meg&rsquo;s true-bred; she&rsquo;s the last in the gang
that will start; but she has some <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>queer ways,
and often cuts queer words.&rsquo;&nbsp; With more of this
gibberish, they continued the conversation, rendering it thus,
even to each other, a dark, obscure dialect, eked out by
significant nods and signs, but never expressing distinctly or in
plain language the subject on which it turned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>G. P. Whyte-Melville speaks of the Russian Gipsies in the
language of fiction in his &ldquo;Interpreter&rdquo; as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The morning sun smiles upon a motley troop
journeying towards the Danube.&nbsp; Two or three lithe, supple
urchins, bounding and dancing along with half-naked bodies, and
bright black eyes shining through knotted elf-locks, form the
advanced guard.&nbsp; Half-a-dozen donkeys seem to carry the
whole property of the tribe.&nbsp; The main body consists of
sinewy, active-looking men, and strikingly handsome girls, all
walking with the free, graceful air and elastic gait peculiar to
those whose lives are passed entirely in active exercise, under
no roof but that of heaven.&nbsp; Dark-browed women in the very
meridian of beauty bring up the rear, dragging or carrying a race
of swarthy progeny, all alike distinguished for the sparkling
eyes and raven hair, which, with a cunning nothing can overreach,
and a nature nothing can tame, seem to be the peculiar
inheritance of the Gipsy.&nbsp; Their costume is striking, not to
say grotesque.&nbsp; Some of the girls, and all the matrons, bind
their brows with various coloured handkerchiefs, which form a
very picturesque and not unbecoming head-gear; whilst in a few
instances coins even of gold are strung amongst the jetty locks
of the Zingyni beauties.&nbsp; The men are not so particular in
their attire.&nbsp; One sinewy fellow wears only a goatskin shirt
and a string of beads round his neck, but the generality are clad
in the coarse cloth of the country, much tattered, and bearing
evident symptoms of weather and wear.&nbsp; The little
mischievous urchins who are clinging round their mothers&rsquo;
necks, or dragging back from their mothers&rsquo; hands, and
holding on to their mothers&rsquo; skirts, are almost
naked.&nbsp; Small heads and hands and feet, all the marks of
what we are <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>accustomed to term high birth, are
hereditary among the Gipsies; and we doubt if the Queen of the
South herself was a more queenly-looking personage than the dame
now marching in the midst of the throng, and conversing earnestly
with her companion, a resolute-looking man scarce entering upon
the prime of life, with a Gipsy complexion, but a bearing in
which it is not difficult to recognise the soldier.&nbsp; He is
talking to his protectress&mdash;for such she is&mdash;with a
military frankness and vivacity, which even to that royal
personage, accustomed though she be to exact all the respect due
to her rank, appear by no means displeasing.&nbsp; The lady is
verging on the autumn of her charms (their summer must have been
scorching indeed!), and though a masculine beauty, is a beauty
nevertheless.&nbsp; Black-browed is she, and deep-coloured, with
eyes of fire, and locks of jet, even now untinged with
grey.&nbsp; Straight and regular are her features, and the wide
mouth, with its strong, even dazzling teeth, betokens an energy
and force of will which would do credit to the other sex.&nbsp;
She has the face of a woman that would dare much, labour much,
everything but <i>love</i> much.&nbsp; She ought to be a queen,
and she <i>is</i> one, none the less despotic for ruling over a
tribe of Gipsies instead of a civilised community . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Every Gipsy can tell fortunes; mine has been
told many a time, but it never came true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was studying the lines on his palm with earnest
attention.&nbsp; She raised her dark eyes angrily to his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Blind! blind!&rsquo; she answered, in a low,
eager tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;The best of you cannot see a yard upon
your way.&nbsp; Look at that white road, winding and winding many
a mile before us upon the plain.&nbsp; Because it is flat and
soft and smooth as far as we can see, will there be no hills on
our journey, no rocks to cut our feet, no thorns to tear our
limbs?&nbsp; Can you see the Danube rolling on far, far before
us?&nbsp; Can you see the river you will have to cross some day,
or can you tell me where it leads?&nbsp; I have the map of our
journey here in my brain; I have the map of your career here on
your <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>hand.&nbsp; Once more I say, when
the chiefs are in council, and the hosts are melting like snow
before the sun, and the earth quakes, and the heavens are filled
with thunder, and the shower that falls scorches and crushes and
blasts&mdash;remember me!&nbsp; I follow the line of wealth: Man
of gold! spoil on; here a horse, there a diamond; hundreds to
uphold the right, thousands to spare the wrong; both hands full,
and broad lands near a city of palaces, and a king&rsquo;s
favour, and a nation of slaves beneath thy foot.&nbsp; I follow
the line of pleasure: costly amber; rich embroidery; dark eyes
melting for the Croat; glances unveiled for the shaven head, many
and loving and beautiful; a garland of roses, all for
one&mdash;rose by rose plucked and withered and thrown away; one
tender bud remaining; cherish it till it blows, and wear it till
it dies.&nbsp; I follow the line of blood:&mdash;it leads towards
the rising sun&mdash;charging squadrons with lances in rest, and
a wild shout in a strange tongue; and the dead wrapped in grey,
with charm and amulet that were powerless to save; and hosts of
many nations gathered by the sea&mdash;pestilence, famine,
despair, and victory.&nbsp; Rising on the whirlwind, chief among
chiefs, the honoured of leaders, the counsellor of
princes&mdash;remember me!&nbsp; But ha! the line is
crossed.&nbsp; Beware! trust not the sons of the adopted land;
when the lily is on thy breast, beware of the dusky shadow on the
wall! beware, and remember me!&rsquo; . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;I proffered my hand readily to the Gipsy, and crossed
it with one of the two pieces of silver which constituted the
whole of my worldly wealth.&nbsp; The Gipsy laughed, and began to
prophesy in German.&nbsp; There are some events a child never
forgets; and I remember every word she said as well as if it had
been spoken yesterday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Over the sea, and again over the sea; thou shalt
know grief and hardship and losses, and the dove shall be driven
from its nest.&nbsp; And the dove&rsquo;s heart shall become like
the eagle&rsquo;s, that flies alone, and fleshes her beak in the
slain.&nbsp; Beat on, though the poor wings be bruised by the
tempest, <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>and the breast be sore, and the
heart sink; beat on against the wind, and seek no shelter till
thou find thy resting-place at last.&nbsp; The time will
come&mdash;only beat on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman laughed as she spoke; but there was a kindly
tone in her voice and a pitying look in her bright eyes that went
straight to my heart.&nbsp; Many a time since, in life, when the
storm has indeed been boisterous and the wings so weary, have I
thought of those words of encouragement, &lsquo;The time will
come&mdash;beat on.&rsquo; . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thou shalt be a &ldquo;De Rohan,&rdquo; my
darling, and I can promise thee no brighter lot&mdash;broad
acres, and blessings from the poor, and horses, and wealth, and
honours.&nbsp; And the sword shall spare thee, and the battle
turn aside to let thee pass.&nbsp; And thou shalt wed a fair
bride with dark eyes and a queenly brow; but beware of St.
Hubert&rsquo;s Day.&nbsp; Birth and burial, birth and
burial&mdash;beware of St. Hubert&rsquo;s Day.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disraeli, speaking of the Gipsies in his
&ldquo;Venetia,&rdquo; says:&mdash;&ldquo;As Cadurcis approached
he observed some low tents, and in a few minutes he was in the
centre of an encampment of Gipsies.&nbsp; He was for a moment
somewhat dismayed, for he had been brought up with the usual
terror of these wild people; nevertheless he was not unequal to
the occasion.&nbsp; He was surrounded in an instant, but only
with women and children, for Gipsy men never immediately
appear.&nbsp; They smiled with their bright eyes, and the flashes
of the watch-fire threw a lurid glare over their dark and
flashing countenances; they held out their practised hands; they
uttered unintelligible, but not unfriendly sounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matilda Betham Edwards, in her remarks upon Gipsies,
says:&mdash;&ldquo;Your pulses are quickened to Gipsy pitch, you
are ready to make love or war, to heal and slay, to wander to the
world&rsquo;s end, to be outlawed and hunted down, to dare and do
anything for the sake of the sweet, untramelled life of the tent,
the bright blue sky, the mountain air, the free savagedom, the
joyous dance, the passionate friendship, the fiery
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

about these ignorant, nomadic tribes, who have been skulking and

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He grows, like the young oak, healthy and

Half-naked he wades in the limpid stream,<br />

That sends its light from heaven afar,<br />
Wild with the strains of thy guitar,<br />

Then, maiden fair, beneath this star,<br />
Come, touch me with the light guitar.<br />
Thy brow unworked by lines of care,<br />
Decked with locks of raven hair,<br />
Seems ever beautiful and fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At moonlight&rsquo;s stilly hour.<br />
What bliss! beside the leafy maze,<br />
Illumined by the moon&rsquo;s pale rays,<br />
On thy sweet face to sit and gaze,<br />

</a></p>
<p>In Part III. I have endeavoured, as well as I have been able,
to show some of the agencies that have been set in motion during
the last three centuries for and against the Gipsies, with a view
to their extermination, by the hang-man, to their being reclaimed
by the religious zeal and fervour of the minister, and to their
improvement by the artificial means of poetry, fiction, and
romance.&nbsp; First, the persecution dealt out to the Gipsies in
this, as well as other countries, during a period of several
centuries, although to a large extent brought upon themselves by
their horrible system of lying and deception, neither
exterminated them nor improved their habits; but, on the
contrary, they increased and spread like mushrooms; the oftener
they were trampled upon the more they seemed to thrive; the more
they were hated, hunted, and driven into hiding-places the
oftener these sly, fortune-telling, lying foxes would be seen
sneaking across our path, ready to grab our chickens and young
turkeys as opportunities presented themselves.&nbsp; Second, that
when stern justice said &ldquo;it is enough,&rdquo; persecution
hanging down its hands and revenge drooping her head, a few
noble-hearted men, filled with missionary zeal, took up the cause
of the Gipsies for a period of nearly forty years in various
forms and ways at the end of the last and the commencement of the
present century.&nbsp; Except in a few isolated cases, they also
failed in producing any noticeable <!-- page 193--><a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>change in
either the moral, social, or religious condition of the Gipsies,
and with the death of Hoyland, Borrow, Crabb, Roberts, and
others, died the last flicker of a flickering light that was to
lead these poor, deluded, benighted heathen wanderers upon a road
to usefulness, honesty, uprightness, and industry.&nbsp; Third,
that on the decline of religious zeal, fervour, and philanthropy
on behalf of the Gipsies more than forty years ago the spasmodic
efforts of poets, novelists, and dramatists, in a variety of
forms of fiction and romance, came to the front, to lead them to
the goal through a lot of questionable by-lanes, queer places,
and artificial lights, the result being that these melodramatic
personages have left the Gipsies in a more pitiable condition
than they were before they took up their cause, although they, in
doing so, put &ldquo;two faces under one hat,&rdquo; blessing and
cursing, smiling and frowning, all in one breath, praising their
faults and sins, and damning their <i>few</i> virtues.&nbsp; In
fact, to such a degree have fiction writers painted the black
side of a Gipsy&rsquo;s life, habits, and character in glowing
colours that, to take another 20,000 men, women, and children out
of our back slums and sink-gutters and write the word
&ldquo;Gipsy&rdquo; upon their back, instead of
&ldquo;scamp,&rdquo; and send them through the country with a few
donkeys, some long sticks, old blankets and rags, dark eyes,
dirty faces, filthy bodies, short petticoats, and old scarlet
hoods and cloaks, you would in fifty years make this country not
worth living in.&nbsp; It is my decided conviction that unless we
are careful, and take the &ldquo;bull by the horns,&rdquo; and
compel them to educate their children, and to put their
habitations, tents, and vans under better sanitary arrangements,
we shall be fostering seeds in these dregs of society that will
one day put a stop to the work of civilisation, and bring to an
end the advance in arts, science, laws, and commerce that have
been making such rapid strides in this country of late years.</p>
<p>It is more pleasant to human nature to sit upon a stile on a
midsummer eve, down a country lane, in the twilight, as the <!--
page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>shades of evening are gathering around you, the stars
twinkling over head, the little silver stream rippling over the
pebbles at your feet in sounds like the distant warbling of the
lark, and the sweet notes of the nightingale ringing in your
ears, than to visit the abodes of misery, filth, and squalor
among the Gipsies in their wigwams.&nbsp; It is more agreeable to
the soft parts of our hearts and our finer feelings to listen to
the melody and harmony of lively, lovely damsels as they send
forth their enchanting strains than to hear the cries of the poor
little, dirty Gipsy children sending forth their piteous moans
for bread.&nbsp; It is more delightful to the poetic and
sentimental parts of our nature to guide over the stepping-stones
a number of bright, sharp, clean, lively, interesting, little
dears, with their &ldquo;hoops,&rdquo;
&ldquo;shuttle-cocks,&rdquo; and &ldquo;battle-doors,&rdquo; than
to be seated among a lot of little ragged, half-starved Gipsy
children, who have never known what soap, water, and comb
are.&nbsp; It is more in harmony with our sensibilities to sit
and listen to the drollery, wit, sarcasm, and fun of <i>Punch</i>
than to the horrible tales of blood, revenge, immorality, and
murder that some of the adult Gipsies delight in setting
forth.&nbsp; It is more in accordance with our feelings to sit
and admire the innocent, angelic being, the perfection of the
good and beautiful, than to sit by the hardened, wicked, ugly,
old Gipsy woman who has spent a lifetime in sin and debauchery,
cursing the God who made her as she expires.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
these things have to be done if we are to have the angelic beings
from the other world ministering to our wants, and wafting us
home as we leave our tenement of clay behind to receive the
&ldquo;Well done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I will now, as we pass along, endeavour to show what the
actual condition of the Gipsies has been in the past, and what it
is at the present time, which, in some cases, has been touched
upon previously, with reference to the moral, social, and
religious traits in their character that go to the making up of a
<span class="smcap">man</span>&mdash;the noblest work of
God.&nbsp; The peculiar fascinating charms about them, conjured
up by <!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>ethnologists and philologists, I
will leave for those learned gentlemen to deal with as they may
think well.&nbsp; I will, however, say that, as regards their
so-called language, it is neither more nor less than gibberish,
not &ldquo;full of sound and fury signifying nothing,&rdquo; but
full of &ldquo;sound and fury&rdquo; signifying something.&nbsp;
They never converse with it openly among themselves for a good
purpose, as the Frenchmen, Germans, Turks, Spaniards, or other
foreigners do.&nbsp; Some of the old Gipsies have a thousand or
more leading words made up from various sources, English, French,
German, Spanish, Indian, &amp;c., which they teach their
children, and use in the presence of strangers with a certain
amount of pride, and, at the same time, to throw dust into their
eyes while the Gipsies are talking among themselves.&nbsp; They
will in the same breath bless you in English and curse you in
Romany; this I experienced myself lately while sitting in a tent
among a dozen uninteresting-looking Gipsies, while they one and
all were thanking me for taking steps to get the children
educated.&nbsp; There was one among them who with a smile upon
his face, was cursing me in Romany from his heart.&nbsp; Many
writers differ in the spelling and pronunciation of Gipsy words,
and what strikes me as remarkable is, the Gipsies themselves are
equally confused upon these points.&nbsp; No doubt the confusion
in the minds of writers arises principally from the fact that
they have had their information from ignorant, lying, deceiving
Gipsies.&nbsp; Almost all Gipsies have an inveterate hatred and
jealousy towards each other, especially if one sets himself up as
knowing more than John Jones in the next yard.&nbsp; One Gipsy
would say paanengro-g&uacute;jo means sailor, or water gentile,
another Gipsy would say it means an Irishman, or potato gentile;
another would say poovengri-g&uacute;jo meant a sailor; another
would say it means an Irishman.&nbsp; They glory in
contradictions and mystification.&nbsp; I was at an encampment a
few days ago, and out of the twenty-five men and women and forty
children there were <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>not three that could talk Romany,
and there was not one who could spell a single word of it.&nbsp;
Their language, like themselves, was Indian enough, no doubt,
when they started on their pilgrimage many centuries ago; but, as
a consequence of their mixing with the scum of other nations in
their journey westward, the charm in their language and
themselves has pretty nearly by this time vanished.&nbsp; If I
were to attempt to write a book about their language it would not
do the Gipsies one iota of good.&nbsp; &ldquo;God bless
you&rdquo; are words the Gipsies very often use when showing
their kindness for favours received, and, as a kind of test, I
have tried to find out lately if there were any Gipsies round
London who could tell me what these words were in Romany, and I
have only found one who could perform the task.&nbsp; They all
shake their heads and say, &ldquo;Ours is not a language, only
slang, which we use when required.&rdquo;&nbsp; Taking their
slang generally, according to Grellmann, Hoyland, Borrow, Smart,
and Crofton, there is certainly nothing very elevating about
it.&nbsp; Worldliness, sensuality, and devilism are things helped
forward by their gibberish.&nbsp; Words dealing with honesty,
uprightness, fidelity, industry, religion, cleanliness, and love
are very sparse.</p>
<p>William Stanley, a converted Gipsy, said, some years since,
that &ldquo;God bless you&rdquo; was in Romany, Artmee
Devillesty; Smart and Crofton say it is, Do&ograve;vel,
p&agrave;rav, p&agrave;rik toot, to&ograve;ti.&nbsp; In another
place they say it is Doovel jal toos&agrave;.&nbsp; Mrs. Simpson
says it is, Mi-Doovel-kom-tooti.&nbsp; Mrs. Smith says it is
Mi-Doovel Andy-Paratuta.</p>
<p>The following are the whole of the slang words Smart and
Crofton have under the letters indicated, and which words are
taken principally from Grellmann, Hoyland, Borrow, and Dr.
Paspati:&mdash;</p>

199</span>I cannot find joy, delight, eternity, innocent, ever,
everlasting, endless, hereafter, and similar words, and, on
inquiry, I find that many of the Gipsies do not believe in an
eternity, future punishment, or rewards; this belief, no doubt,
has its effects upon their morals in this life.</p>
<p>The opinion respecting the Gipsy language at the commencement
of the present century was, that it was composed only of cant
terms, or of what has been called the slang of beggars; much of
this probably was promoted and strengthened by the dictionary
contained in a pamphlet, entitled, &ldquo;The Life and Adventures
of Bamfylde Moore Carew.&rdquo;&nbsp; It consists for the most
part of English words trumped up apparently not so much for the
purpose of concealment as a burlesque.&nbsp; Even if used by this
people at all, the introduction of this cant and slang as the
genuine language of the community of Gipsies is a gross
imposition on the public.</p>
<p>Rees, in his Encyclop&aelig;dia, 1819, describes the Gipsies
as &ldquo;impostors and jugglers forming a kind of commonwealth
among themselves, who disguise themselves in uncouth habits,
smearing their faces and bodies, and framing to themselves a
canting language, wander up and down, and under pretence of
telling fortunes, curing diseases, &amp;c., abuse the common
people, trick them of their money, and steal all that they come
at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Borrow, speaking of the Hungarian Gipsies in his
&ldquo;Zyncali,&rdquo; page 7, says:&mdash;&ldquo;Hungary, though
a country not a tenth part so extensive as the huge colossus of
the Russian empire, whose Czar reigns over a hundred lands,
contains perhaps as many Gipsies, it not being uncommon to find
whole villages inhabited by this race.&nbsp; They likewise abound
in the suburbs of the towns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Hungary the feudal system still exists in all its
pristine barbarity.&nbsp; In no country does the hard hand of
oppression bear so heavy upon the lower classes&mdash;not even in
Russia.&nbsp; The peasants of Russia are serfs, it is true, but
their condition <!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>is enviable compared with that of
the same class in the other country; they have certain rights and
privileges, and are, upon the whole, happy and contented, at
least, there, whilst the Hungarians are ground to powder.&nbsp;
Two classes are free in Hungary to do almost what they
please&mdash;the nobility and the Gipsies (the former are above
the law, the latter below it).&nbsp; A toll is wrung from the
hands of the hard working labourers, that most meritorious class,
in passing over a bridge, for example, at Perth, which is not
demanded from a well-dressed person, nor from Zingany, who have
frequently no dress at all, and whose <i>insouciance</i> stands
in striking contrast with the trembling submission of the
peasants.&nbsp; The Gipsy, wherever you find him, is an
incomprehensible being, but nowhere more than in Hungary, where
in the midst of slavery he is free, though apparently one step
lower than the lowest slave.&nbsp; The habits of the Hungarian
Gipsies are abominable; their hovels appear sinks of the vilest
poverty and filth; their dress is at best rags; their food
frequently of the vilest carrion, and occasionally, if report be
true, still worse: thus they live in filth, in rags, in
nakedness.&nbsp; The women are fortune-tellers.&nbsp; Of course
both sexes are thieves of the first water.&nbsp; They roam where
they list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Chronicle of Bologna,&rdquo; printed about the year
1422, says:&mdash;&ldquo;And of those who went to have their
fortunes told few there were who had not their purses stolen, or
some portion of their garments cut away.&nbsp; Their women also
traversed the city six or eight together, entering the houses of
the citizens, and diverting them with idle talk while one of the
party secured whatever she could lay her hands upon.&nbsp; In the
shops they pretended to buy, but in fact stole.&nbsp; They were
amongst the cleverest thieves that the world contained.&nbsp; Be
it noted that they were the most hideous crew ever seen in these
parts.&nbsp; They were lean and black, and ate like pigs.&nbsp;
The women wore mantles flung upon one shoulder, with only a vest
underneath.&rdquo;&nbsp; Forli, who wrote about them about the
<!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>same time as the &ldquo;Chronicle of Bologna,&rdquo;
does not seem to have liked them, and says they were not
&ldquo;even civilised, and resembling rather savage and untamed
beasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A writer describes a visit to a Gipsy&rsquo;s tent as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;We were in a wigwam which afforded us but
miserable shelter from the inclemency of the season.&nbsp; The
storm raged without; the tempest roared in the open country; the
wind blew with violence, and whistled through the fissures of the
cabin; the rain fell in torrents, and prevented us from
continuing our route.&nbsp; Our host was an Indian with sparkling
and intelligent eyes, clad with a certain elegance, and wrapped
majestically in a large fur cloak.&nbsp; Seated close to the
fire, which cast a reddish gleam through the interior of the
wigwam, he felt himself all at once seized with an irresistible
desire to imitate the convulsion of nature, and to sing his
impressions.&nbsp; So taking hold of a drum which hung near his
bed, he beat a slight rolling, resembling the distant sounds of
an approaching storm, then raising his voice to a shrill treble,
which he knew how to soften when he pleased, he imitated the
whistling of the air, the creaking of the branches dashing
against one another, and the particular noise produced by dead
leaves when accumulated in compact masses on the ground.&nbsp; By
degrees the rollings of the drum became more frequent and louder,
the chants more sonorous and shrill; and at last our Indian
shrieked, howled, and roared in the most frightful manner; he
struggled and struck his instrument with extraordinary rapidity;
it was a real tempest, to which nothing was wanting, not even the
distant howling of the dogs, nor the bellowing of the affrighted
buffaloes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Leland, speaking of the Russian Gipsies near Moscow, says
that after meeting them in public, and penetrating to their
homes, they were altogether original, deeply interesting, and
able to read and write, and have a wonderful capacity for music,
and goes on to say that he speedily found the Russian Gipsies
were as unaffected and childlike as they <!-- page 202--><a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>were gentle
in manner, and that compared with our own prize-fighting, sturdy,
begging, and always suspecting Gipsy roughs, as a delicate
greyhound might compare with a very shrewd old bulldog trained by
a fly tramp.&nbsp; Leland, in his article, speaking of one of the
Russian Gipsy maidens, says:&mdash;&ldquo;Miss Sarsha, who had a
slight cast in one of her wild black eyes, which added something
to the Gipsiness and roguery of her smiles, and who wore in a
ring a large diamond, which seemed as if it might be the right
eye in the wrong place, was what is called an earnest young lady,
and with plenty to say and great energy wherewith to say
it.&nbsp; What with her eyes, her diamond, her smiles, and her
tongue, she constituted altogether a fine specimen of
irrepressible fireworks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leland, referring to the musical abilities of the Russian
Gipsies, in his article in &ldquo;Macmillan&rsquo;s
Magazine,&rdquo; November, 1879, says:&mdash;&ldquo;These
artists, with wonderful tact and untaught skill have succeeded in
all their songs in combining the mysterious and maddening chorus
of the true wild eastern music with that of regular and simple
melody intelligible to every western ear.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
listened,&rdquo; says Leland, &ldquo;to the strangest, wildest,
and sweetest singing I ever had heard&mdash;the singing of
Lurleis, of syrens, of witches.&nbsp; First, one damsel, with an
exquisitely clear, firm voice began to sing a verse of a love
ballad, and as it approached the end the chorus stole in, softly
and unperceived, but with exquisite skill, until, in a few
seconds, the summer breeze, murmuring melody over a rippling
lake, seemed changed to a midnight tempest roaring over a stormy
sea, in which the basso of the black captain pealed like thunder,
and as it died away a second girl took up the melody, very
sweetly, but with a little more excitement&mdash;it was like a
gleam of moonlight on the still agitated waters&mdash;a strange
contralto witch gleam, and then again the chorus and the storm,
and then another solo yet sweeter, sadder, and stranger&mdash;the
movement continually increasing, until all was fast, and wild,
<!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>and mad&mdash;a locomotive quick step and then a sudden
silence&mdash;sunlight&mdash;the storm had blown away;&rdquo; and
adds, &ldquo;I could only think of those strange fits of
excitement which thrill the Red Indian, and make him burst into
song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the first Gipsy lyric then came another to which
the captain especially directed my attention as being what Sam.
Petalengro calls &lsquo;The girl in the red
chemise&rsquo;&mdash;as well as I can recall his words.&nbsp; A
very sweet song, with a simple but spirited chorus, and as the
sympathetic electricity of excitement seized the performers we
were all in a minute going down the rapids in a spring
freshet.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sing, sir, sing!&rsquo; cried my handsome
neighbour, with her black Gipsy eyes sparkling fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some excuse ought to be made for Leland getting into this wild
state of excitement, for he had on his right and on his left,
before and behind him, dark-eyed Gipsy beauties&mdash;as some
would call them&mdash;among whom was one, the belle of the party,
dressed in black silk attire, wafting in his face the enchanting
fan of fascination till he was completely mesmerised.&nbsp; How
different this hour&rsquo;s excitement to the twenty-three
hours&rsquo; reality!</p>
<p>The following is the full history of a remarkable case which
has recently occurred in Russia, taken from the London daily
papers last November, and it shows the way in which Gipsy witches
and fortune-tellers are held and horribly treated in that
country.&nbsp; It is quite evident that Gipsies and witches are
not esteemed by the Russians like angels:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Agrafena Ignatjewa was as a child simple and
amiable, neither sharper nor more stupid than all the other girls
of her native village, Wratschewo, in the Government of
Novgorod.&nbsp; But the people of the place having, from her
early youth, made up their minds that she had the &ldquo;evil
eye,&rdquo; nothing could eradicate that impression.</p>
<p>Being branded with this reputation, it naturally followed <!--
page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>that powers of divination and enchantment were
attributed to her, including the ability to afflict both men and
animals with various plagues and sicknesses.</p>
<p>In spite, however, of the supernatural skill with which she
was credited, she met with no suitor save a poor soldier.&nbsp;
She accepted him gladly, and going with him, shortly after her
marriage, to St. Petersburg, Wratschewo lost sight of her for
some twelve years.&nbsp; She was, however, by no means forgotten
there, for when, after the death of her husband, she again betook
herself to the home of her childhood, she found that her old
reputation still clung to her.&nbsp; The news of her return
spread like wild-fire, and general disaster was anticipated from
her injurious spells.&nbsp; This, however, was, from fear, talked
of only behind her back, and dread of her at length reached such
a pitch that the villagers and their wives sent her presents and
assisted her in every way, hoping thereby to get into her good
graces, and so escape being practised upon by her infernal
arts.&nbsp; As she was now fifty years of age, somewhat weakly,
and therefore unable to earn a living, these attentions were by
no means unwelcome, and she therefore did nothing to disabuse her
neighbours&rsquo; minds.&nbsp; Their superstition enabled her to
live comfortably and without care, and she knew very well that
any assurances she might give would not have produced the
slightest effect.</p>
<p>A short time after her return to Wratschewo, several women
fell ill.&nbsp; This was, of course, laid at the door of
Ignatjewa, particularly as one of these women, the daughter of a
peasant, had been attacked immediately after being refused a
slight favour by her.&nbsp; Whenever any misfortune whatsoever
happened in the village, all fingers pointed to Ignatjewa as the
source of it.&nbsp; At the beginning of the present year a
dismissed soldier, in the interest of the community, actually
instituted criminal proceedings against her before the local
urjadnik, the chief of the police of the district, the immediate
charge preferred being that she had bewitched his wife.</p>
<p><!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>Meanwhile the feeling in the village against her became
so intensified that it was resolved by the people, pending the
decision on the complaint that had been lodged, to take the law
into their hands so far as to fasten her up in her cottage.</p>
<p>The execution of this resolve was not delayed a moment.&nbsp;
Led by Kauschin, Nikisorow, Starovij, and an old man of seventy,
one Schipensk, whose wife and daughters were at the time supposed
to be suffering from her witchcraft, a crowd of villagers set out
on the way to Ignatjewa&rsquo;s dwelling.&nbsp; Nikisorow had
provided himself with hammer and nails, and Iwanow with some
chips of pinewood &ldquo;to smoke out the bad
spirits.&rdquo;&nbsp; Finding the cottage door locked, they beat
it in, and while a portion of them nailed up the windows the
remainder crowded in and announced to the terrified woman that,
by unanimous decision, she was, for the present, to be kept
fastened up in her house.&nbsp; Some of them then proceeded to
look through the rooms, where they found, unfortunately, several
bottles containing medicaments.&nbsp; Believing these to be
enchanted potions, and therefore conclusive proofs of
Ignatjewa&rsquo;s guilt, it was decided, on the suggestion of
Nikisorow, to burn her and her devilish work there and
then.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must put an end to it,&rdquo; shouted the
peasants in chorus; &ldquo;if we let her off now we shall be
bewitched one and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kauschin, who held in his hand a lighted chip of pine-wood,
which he had used &ldquo;to smoke out the spirits&rdquo; and to
light him about the premises, instantly applied it to a bundle of
straw lying in a room, after which all hastily left.&nbsp;
Ignatjewa attempted in vain to follow them.&nbsp; The agonised
woman then tried to get out at the windows, but these were
already nailed up.&nbsp; In front of the cottage stood the
people, blankly staring at the spreading flames, and listening to
the cries of their victim without moving a muscle.</p>
<p>At this point Ignatjewa&rsquo;s brother came on the scene, and
ran towards the cottage to rescue his sister.&nbsp; But a dozen
<!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>arms held him back.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let her
out,&rdquo; shouted the venerable Schipensk, the husband and
father of the bewitched women.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer for
it, that we won&rsquo;t, father; we have put up with her long
enough,&rdquo; replied one of the band.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lord be
praised!&rdquo; exclaimed another, &ldquo;let her burn away; she
bewitched my daughters too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little room in which Ignatjewa had taken refuge was not as
yet reached by the fire.&nbsp; Appeals were now made to her to
confess herself a witch, the brother joining, probably in the
hope that if she did so her life might be spared.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I am entirely innocent,&rdquo; the poor woman cried
out.&nbsp; One of the bystanders, apparently the only one in
possession of his five senses, made another attempt at rescue,
but was hindered by the mob.&nbsp; He then, in loud tones, warned
them of the punishment which would certainly await them, but in
vain, no attention was paid to him.&nbsp; On the contrary, the
progress of the flames not appearing rapid enough, it was
endeavoured to accelerate it by shoving the snow from the roof
and loosening the frame-work.&nbsp; The fire now extended
rapidly, one beam after another blazed up, and at length the roof
fell in on the wretched woman.</p>
<p>The ashes smouldered the whole night; on the following morning
nothing was found remaining but the charred bones of
Ignatjewa.</p>
<p>The idea now, it would seem, occurred to the murderers that
perhaps, after all, their action had not been altogether
lawful.&nbsp; They accordingly resolved to bribe the local
authority, who had already viewed the scene of the affair, to
hush it up.&nbsp; For this purpose they made a collection, and
handed him the proceeds, twenty-one roubles ninety copecks.&nbsp;
To their astonishment he did not accept the money, but at once
reported the horrible deed to his superior officer.&nbsp; Sixteen
of the villagers were, in consequence, brought up for trial at
Tichwin before the district court of Novgorod on the charge of
murdering Agrafena Ignatjewa, in the manner above described.</p>
<p><!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>After a protracted hearing with jury the following
result was arrived at:&mdash;Kauschin, who had first set fire to
the building; Starovij, who had assisted in accelerating the
burning; and Nikisorow, the prime mover in the matter, who had
nailed up the windows, were found guilty, and sentenced by the
judge to some slight ecclesiastical penance, while the remaining
thirteen, including the aged Schipensk&mdash;who had used his
influence to prevent a rescue&mdash;went scot free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Spanish Gipsies, in Grellmann&rsquo;s day, would resort to
the most wicked and inhuman practices.&nbsp; Before taking one of
their horses to the fair they would make an incision in some
secret part of the skin, through which they would blow the
creature up till his flesh looked fat and plump, and then they
would apply a strong sticking plaster to prevent the air
escaping.&nbsp; Wolfgang Franz says they make use of another
device with an eel.&nbsp; Grellmann says of the Spanish Gipsies
in his day that dancing was another means of getting something;
they generally practised dancing when they were begging,
particularly if men were about the streets.&nbsp; Their dances
were of the most disgusting kind that could be conceived; the
most lascivious attitudes and gestures, young girls and married
women, travelling with their fathers, would indulge in, to the
extent of frisking about the streets in a state of nudity.</p>
<p>Further inquiries among the Gipsies more than ever satisfy me
that my first statement last August, viz., that five per cent. of
them could not read and write, is being more than fully borne out
by facts brought under my notice; in fact, I question if there
will be three per cent. of the Gipsies who can read and
write.&nbsp; The following letter has been sent to me by a friend
to show that there is one Gipsy in the country, at least, who
knows how to put a letter together, and as it is somewhat of a
curiosity I give it, as exactly as possible as I received it, of
course leaving out the name, and without note or comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the first weakning in the morning (mother speaking

Mother, I am going to send her to the farm House for milk (jack
loses mony) when a Bran of fire is flying after him, and he (the
boy) over a big piece of wood, and hurts his knea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl goes for the milk (and she has a river to go

tents, and begins to scould very much.&nbsp; (The little girl
comes with the milk.)&nbsp; The girl <!-- page 210--><a

brother that she may fall over the wooden in the river for what
he cared; yet the boy said that when she would fall down she
would chin a bit, and all the fish would come and nibble at
her.&nbsp; Horras and her bull; and then they began the scrubble,
and begins to scould her brother for not going to meet her, when
they boath have a scuffel over the fire, and very near knocks the
jockett over, when the boy hops away upon one leg, and hops upon
one of the dog&rsquo;s paws&mdash;un-seen&mdash;and dog runs away
barking, and runs himself near one of the Donkeys, and the Donkey
gives him a kick, until he is briging in the horse.&nbsp; The old
woman: Dare now, dare now, ockkie now chorro jocked mardo.&nbsp;
Breakfast is over with a deal of boather, and a little laughing
and cursing and swaring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They strike the tents.&nbsp; (The old woman)&nbsp; Men

drom codires, and you will meet me near old Town.&nbsp; Be shewer
and leave a <i>pattern</i> by the side of the cross road, if you
sal be dare before me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(The old man and the Boys Pitches the Tents) and gets
himself ready to go to the Town.&nbsp; The old woman comes up,
and one of the girls with her&mdash;boath very tired and havey,
loaded with <i>choben</i> behind her back, anugh to frighten
waggens and carts of the road with her humpey back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(They intend to stay in this delightfull camping place
for a good many days.)&nbsp; To day is soposid to be a very hot
day, and a fare day in a Town about three miles and &frac12; from
there.&nbsp; The old woman and one of her Daughters goes out as
usual.&nbsp; The old man takes a couple of Horses to the Fare to
try and sell.&nbsp; (The boys go a fishing.)&nbsp; The day is
very bright and hot.&nbsp; (The old man soon comes home.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the prityist girls takes a strol by herself down
to a butyfull streem of water to have herself a wash, and she
begins singing to the sound of a waterfall close by her, when all
of a suden a very nice looking young gentleman, who got tiard
fishing in the morning, and the day being very hot, <!-- page
211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>took a bit of a lull on his face, his basket on his
back, and Fishing-rod by his side (the girl did not see him) nor
him her) until he was atracted by some strange sound, when all of
a instant he sprung upon his heels, and to his surprise seen a
most butyfull creature with her bear bosom and her long black
hair and butyfull black eyes, white teeth, and a butyfull
figure.&nbsp; He stared with all the eyes he had, and he made a
advance towards her, and when she seen him she stared also at
him, and aproaching slowly towards her and saying, from whence
comest thou hear, my butyfull maid (and staring at her butyfull
figure) thinking that she was some angel as droped down (when she
with a pleasant smile by showing her ivory and her sparkling
eyes)&nbsp; Oh, my father&rsquo;s tents are not fare off, and
seen the day very warm I thought to have a little wash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentleman Well indeed I have been fishing to day, and
cot a few this morning; but the day turned out so excesably hot I
was obliged to go in to a shade and have a sleep, but was alarmed
at your sweet voice mingling with the murmuring waters.&nbsp;
They boath steer up to the camp, when now and then as he is
speaking to her on the road going up, a loude and shrill laugh is
heard many times&mdash;the same time he does not sho the least
sign of vulgaraty by taking any sort of liberty with her
whatever.&nbsp; They arrive at the tents, when one or the little
boys says to his dady Dady, dady, there is a rye a velin a
pra.&nbsp; The gentleman sitts himself down and pulls out a big
Flask very near full of Brandy and toboco, and offers to the old
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time that young girl goes in her Tent and pull
down the front, and presently out she comes butyfully dressed,
which bewitched the young gentleman, and he said that they were
welcome to come there to stop as long as they had a mind so as
they would not tear the Headges.&nbsp; He goes and leaves them
highly delighted towards hime, and he should pay them another
visit.&nbsp; This camping ground belonged to the young
gentleman&rsquo;s father, and is situated in <!-- page 212--><a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>a butyfull
part of Derbyshire.&nbsp; One of the little girls sees two young
ladys coming a little sideways across the common from a
gentleman&rsquo;s house which is very near, which turns out to be
the gentleman&rsquo;s two sisters.&nbsp; The little girl, Mamey,
mamey, der is doi Rawngas avelin accai atch a pray.&nbsp; The
young ladys comes to the tents and smiles, when the old woman
says to one of them, Good day, meyam, it&rsquo;s a very fine day,
meyam; shall I tell you a few words, meyam?&nbsp; The old woman
takes them on one side and tells them something just to please
them, now and then a word of truth, the rest a good lot of
lies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man goes off for a stroll with a couple of
dogs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the young boys asks his mother for some money,
and she refuses him, or says she has got none.&nbsp; The boy
says, Where is the &pound;000 tooteys sold froom those doi
Rawngas maw did accai I held now from them they pend them not
appopolar?&nbsp; One of the other brothers says to him, Hear,
Abraham, ile lend you 5s.&nbsp; Will you, my blessed
brother.&nbsp; Yes, I will; hear it is.&nbsp; Now we will boath
of us go to the gav togeather.&nbsp; One gets his fiddle ready
and the other the Tamareen.&nbsp; The harp is too heavy to
carry.&nbsp; They go to call at the post office for a
chinginargery&mdash;they boath come home rather wary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next day the Boys go a fishing again and bring home
a good lot (as the day was not near so hot as the day before) and
comes home in good time to play the harp and violin (and
sometimes the Tambureen) for the county gouges [green horns], as
a good many comes to have a dance on the green&mdash;the
collection would be the boys pocket money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a great deal of amusement found by those that

them to hear there music and to dance on the green, or sometimes
in the barn, but most oftener in the house in a big kitchen, and

</blockquote>
<p>It would be perhaps a difficult task to find a score of
Gipsies out of the 15,000 to 20,000 there are in this country who
can write as well as the foregoing letter.</p>
<p>The following may be considered a fair specimen of the high
class or &ldquo;Gentleman Gipsy,&rdquo; so much admired by those
who have got the Gipsy spell round their necks, the Gipsy
spectacles before their eyes, the Gipsy charm in their pocket,
and who can see nothing but what is lively, charming,
fascinating, and delightful in the Gipsy, from the crown of his
head to the sole of his foot.&nbsp; To those of my friends I
present them with an account of Ryley Bosvil as a man after their
own heart, at the same time I would call their attention to his
ending, as related by Borrow.</p>
<p>Ryley Bosvil was a native of Yorkshire, a county where, as the
Gipsies say, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a deadly sight of
Bosvils.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was above the middle height, exceedingly
strong and active, and one of the best riders in Yorkshire, which
is saying a great deal.&nbsp; He was thoroughly versed in all the
arts of the old race; he had two wives, never went to church, and
considered that when a man died he was cast into the earth <!--
page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>and there was an end of him.&nbsp; He frequently used
to say that if any of his people became Gorgios he would kill
them.&nbsp; He had a sister of the name of Clara, a nice,
delicate girl, about fourteen years younger than himself, who
travelled about with an aunt; this girl was noticed by a
respectable Christian family, who, taking great interest in her,
persuaded her to come and live with them.&nbsp; She was
instructed by them, in the rudiments of the Christian religion,
appeared delighted with her new friends, and promised never to
leave them.&nbsp; After the lapse of about six weeks there was a
knock at the door, and a dark man stood before it, who said he
wanted Clara.&nbsp; Clara went out trembling, had some discourse
with the man in an unknown tongue, and shortly returned in tears,
and said that she must go.&nbsp; &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; said her
friends.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you not promise to stay with
us?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I did so,&rdquo; said the girl, weeping
more bitterly; &ldquo;but that man is my brother, who says I must
go with him; and what he says must be.&rdquo;&nbsp; So with her
brother she departed, and her Christian friends never saw her
again.&nbsp; What became of her?&nbsp; Was she made away
with?&nbsp; Many thought she was, but she was not.&nbsp; Ryley
put her into a light cart, drawn by a &ldquo;flying pony,&rdquo;
and hurried her across England, even to distant Norfolk, where he
left her with three Gipsy women.&nbsp; With these women the
writer found her encamped in a dark wood, and had much discourse
with her both on Christian and Egyptian matters.&nbsp; She was
very melancholy, bitterly regretted her having been compelled to
quit her Christian friends, and said that she wished she had
never been a Gipsy.&nbsp; She was exhorted to keep a firm grip of
her Christianity, and was not seen again for a quarter of a
century, when she was met on Epsom Downs on the Derby day, when
the terrible horse, &ldquo;Gladiateur,&rdquo; beat all the
English steeds.&nbsp; She was then very much changed indeed,
appearing as a full-blown Egyptian matron, with two very handsome
daughters flaringly dressed in genuine Gipsy fashion, to whom she
was giving motherly counsels as to the <!-- page 215--><a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>best means
to <i>hok</i> and <i>dukker</i> the gentlefolk.&nbsp; All her
Christianity she appeared to have flung to the dogs, for when the
writer spoke to her on that very important subject she made no
answer save by an indescribable Gipsy look.&nbsp; On other
matters she was communicative enough, telling the writer, amongst
other things, that since he saw her she had been twice married,
and both times very well, for that her first husband, by whom she
had the two daughters, whom the writer &ldquo;kept staring
at,&rdquo; was a man every inch of him, and her second, who was
then on the Downs grinding knives with a machine he had, though
he had not much manhood, being nearly eighty years old, had
something much better, namely, a mint of money, which she hoped
shortly to have in her possession.</p>
<p>Ryley, like most of the Bosvils, was a tinker by profession;
but though a tinker, he was amazingly proud and haughty of
heart.&nbsp; His grand ambition was to be a great man among his
people, a Gipsy king (no such individuals as either Gipsy kings
or queens ever existed).&nbsp; To this end he furnished himself
with clothes made after the costliest Gipsy fashion; the two
hinder buttons of the coat, which was of thick blue cloth, were
broad gold pieces of Spain, generally called ounces; the
fore-buttons were English &ldquo;spaded guineas,&rdquo; the
buttons of the waistcoat were half-guineas, and those of the
collar and the wrists of his shirt were seven-shilling
gold-pieces.&nbsp; In this coat he would frequently make his
appearance on a magnificent horse, whose hoofs, like those of the
steed of a Turkish Sultan, were cased in shoes of silver.&nbsp;
How did he support such expense? it may be asked.&nbsp; Partly by
driving a trade in &ldquo;wafedo loovo,&rdquo; counterfeit coin,
with which he was supplied by certain honest tradespeople of
Brummagem; partly and principally by large sums of money which he
received from his two wives, and which they obtained by the
practice of certain arts peculiar to Gipsy females.&nbsp; One of
his wives was a truly remarkable woman.&nbsp; She was of the
Petalengro or Smith <!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>tribe.&nbsp; Her Christian name, if
Christian name it can be called, was Xuri or Shuri, and from her
exceeding smartness and cleverness she was generally called by
the Gipsies Yocky Shuri&mdash;that is, smart or clever Shuri,
Yocky being a Gipsy word signifying &ldquo;clever.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She could dukker&mdash;that is, tell fortunes&mdash;to
perfection, by which alone, during the racing season, she could
make a hundred pounds a month.&nbsp; She was good at the big
hok&mdash;that is, at inducing people to put money into her hands
in the hope of it being multiplied; and, oh, dear! how she could
caur&mdash;that is, filch gold rings and trinkets from
jewellers&rsquo; cases, the kind of thing which the Spanish
Gipsies call ustibar pastesas&mdash;filching with hands.&nbsp;
Frequently she would disappear and travel about England, and
Scotland too, dukkering, hokking, and cauring, and after the
lapse of a month return and deliver to her husband, like a true
and faithful wife, the proceeds of her industry.&nbsp; So no
wonder that the Flying Tinker, as he was called, was enabled to
cut a grand appearance.&nbsp; He was very fond of hunting, and
would frequently join the field in regular hunting costume, save
and except that instead of the leather hunting cap he wore one of
fur, with a gold band round it, to denote that though he mixed
with Gorgios he was still a Romany chal.&nbsp; Thus equipped, and
mounted on a capital hunter, whenever he encountered a Gipsy
encampment he would invariably dash through it, doing all the
harm he could, in order, as he said, to let the juggals know that
he was their king, and had a right to do what he pleased with his
own.&nbsp; Things went on swimmingly for a great many years, but,
as prosperity does not continue for ever, his dark hour came at
last.&nbsp; His wives got into trouble in one or two expeditions,
and his dealings in wafedo loovo to be noised about.&nbsp;
Moreover, by his grand airs and violent proceedings, he had
incurred the hatred of both Gorgios and Gipsies, particularly of
the latter, some of whom he had ridden over and lamed for
life.&nbsp; One day he addressed his two wives&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>&ldquo;The Gorgios seek to hang
me,<br />
The Gipsies seek to kill me;<br />
This country we must leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Shuri</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll join with you to heaven,<br />
I&rsquo;ll fare with you, Yandors,<br />
But not if Lura goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Lura</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll join with you to heaven<br />
And to the wicked country,<br />
Though Shuri goeth too.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Ryley</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since I must choose betwixt you,<br />
My choice is Yocky Shuri,<br />
Though Lura loves me best.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Lura</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My blackest curse on Shuri;<br />
Oh, Ryley, I&rsquo;ll not curse you,<br />
But you will never thrive.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She then took her departure, with her cart and donkey, and
Ryley remained with Shuri.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Ryley</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve chosen now betwixt ye,<br />
Your wish you now have gotten,<br />
But for it you shall smart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then struck her with his fist on the cheek and broke her
jaw-bone.&nbsp; Shuri uttered no cry or complaint, only
mumbled&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Although with broken jaw-bone,<br />
I&rsquo;ll follow thee, my Riley,<br />
Since Lura doesn&rsquo;t fal.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thereupon Ryley and Yocky Shuri left Yorkshire and wended
their way to London, where they took up their abode in the
Gipsyry near Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush.&nbsp; Shuri went about
dukkering and hokking, but not with the spirit of former times,
for she was not quite so young as she had been, and her jaw,
which was never properly cured, pained her very <!-- page
218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>much.&nbsp; Ryley went about tinkering, but he was
unacquainted with London and its neighbourhood, and did not get
much to do.&nbsp; An old Gipsy man, who was driving about a
little cart filled with skewers, saw him standing in a state of
perplexity at a place where four roads met:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Old

</blockquote>
<p>The old Gipsy showed Ryley about the country for a week or
two, and Ryley formed a kind of connection and did a little
business.&nbsp; He, however, displayed little or no energy, was
gloomy and dissatisfied, and frequently said that his heart was
broken since he had left Yorkshire.&nbsp; Shuri did her best to
cheer him, but without effect.&nbsp; Once when she bade him get
up and exert himself, he said that if he did it would be of no
use, and asked her whether she did not remember the parting
prophecy of his other wife, that he would never thrive.&nbsp; At
the end of about two years he ceased <!-- page 219--><a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>going his
rounds, and did nothing but smoke under the arches of the
railroad and loiter about beershops.&nbsp; At length he became
very weak and took to his bed; doctors were called in by his
faithful Shuri, but there is no remedy for a bruised
spirit.&nbsp; A Methodist came and asked him, &ldquo;What was his
hope?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My hope,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is that
when I am dead I shall be put into the ground, and my wife and
children will weep over me,&rdquo; and such, it may be observed,
is the last hope of every genuine Gipsy.&nbsp; His hope was
gratified.&nbsp; Shuri and his children, of whom he had
three&mdash;two stout young fellows and a girl&mdash;gave him a
magnificent funeral, and screamed and shouted and wept over his
grave.&nbsp; They then returned to the &ldquo;arches,&rdquo; not
to divide his property among them, and to quarrel about the
division, according to Christian practice, but to destroy
it.&nbsp; They killed his swift pony&mdash;still swift though
twenty-seven years of age&mdash;and buried it deep in the ground
without depriving it of its skin.&nbsp; Then they broke the
caravan to pieces, making of the fragments a fire, on which they
threw his bedding, carpets, curtains, blankets, and everything
which would burn.&nbsp; Finally, they dashed his mirrors, china,
and crockery to pieces, hacked his metal pots, dishes, and what
not to bits, and flung the whole on the blazing pile. <a
name="citation219"></a><a href="#footnote219"
class="citation">[219]</a>&nbsp; Such was the life, such the
death, and such were the funeral obsequies of Ryley Bosvil, a
Gipsy who will be long remembered amongst the English Romany for
his buttons, his two wives, grand airs, and last not least, for
having been the composer of various stanzas in the Gipsy tongue,
which have plenty of force if nothing else to recommend
them.&nbsp; One of these, addressed to Yocky Shuri, runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>&ldquo;Beneath the bright sun there
is none,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is none<br
/>
I love like my Yocky Shuri;<br />
With the greatest delight in blood I would fight<br />
To the knees for my Yocky Shuri.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How much better and happier it would have been for this poor,
hardened, ignorant, old Gipsy, if, instead of indulging in such
rubbish as he did in the last hours of an idle and wasted life,
he could, after a life spent in doing good to the Gipsies and
others over whom he had influence, as the shades of the evening
of life gathered round him, sung, from the bottom of his
heart&mdash;fetching tears to his eyes as it did mine a Sunday or
two ago&mdash;the following verses to the tune of
&ldquo;Belmont:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When in the vale of lengthened years<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My feeble feet shall tread,<br />
And I survey the various scenes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through which I have been led,</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many mercies will my life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before my view unfold!<br />
What countless dangers will be past!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What tales of sorrow told!</p>
<p>&ldquo;This scene will all my labours end,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This road conduct on high;<br />
With comfort I&rsquo;ll review the past,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And triumph though I die.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the first Sunday in February this year I found myself
surrounded by a black, thick London fog&mdash;almost as dense as
the blackest midnight, and an overpowering sense of suffocation
creeping over me&mdash;in the midst of an encampment of Gipsies
at Canning Town, and, acting upon their kind invitation, I crept
into one of their tents, and there found about a dozen Gipsy men
of all sizes, ages, and complexions, squatting upon peg
shavings.&nbsp; Some of their faces looked full of intelligence
and worthy of a better vocation, and others seemed as if they had
had the &ldquo;cropper&rdquo; at work round their ears; so short
was their hair <!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>that any one attempting to
&ldquo;pull it up by the roots&rdquo; would have a difficult
task, unless he set to it with his teeth.&nbsp; They looked to me
as if several of them had worn bright steel ornaments round their
wrists and had danced at a county ball, and done more stepping
upon the wheel of fortune than many people imagine; at any rate,
they were quite happy in their way, and seemed prepared for
another turn round when needful.&nbsp; Their first salutation
was, &ldquo;Well, governor, how are you?&nbsp; Sit you down and
make yourself comfortable, and let&rsquo;s have a chat.&nbsp;
Never mind if it is Sunday, send for some &lsquo;fourpenny&rsquo;
for us.&rdquo;&nbsp; I partly did as they bid me, but, owing to
the darkness of the tent and the fog, I sat upon a seat that was
partly covered with filth, consequently I had an addition to my
trousers more than I bargained for.&nbsp; I told them my object
was not to come to send for &ldquo;fourpenny,&rdquo; but to get a
law passed to compel the Gipsy parents to send their children to
school, and to have their tents registered and provided with a
kind of school pass book; and, before I had well finished my
remarks, one of the Gipsies, a good-looking fellow, said,
&ldquo;I say, Bill, that will be a capital thing, won&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;God bless you, man, for it,&rdquo; was
the remark of another, and so the thing went the round among
them.&nbsp; By this time there were some score or more Gipsy
women and children at the tent door, or, I should rather say, rag
coverlet, who heard what had passed, and they thoroughly fell in
with the idea.&nbsp; The question next turned upon
religion.&nbsp; They said they had heard that there were
half-a-dozen different religions, and asked me if it was
true.&nbsp; One said he was a Roman Catholic; but did not believe
there was a hell.&nbsp; Another said he was a Methodist, but
could not agree with their singing and praying, and so it went
round till they asked me what religion was.&nbsp; I told them in
a way that seemed to satisfy them, and I also told them some of
its results.&nbsp; I could not learn that any of these Gipsies
had ever been in a place of worship.</p>
<p><!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>I mentioned to them that I wanted to show, during my
inquiries, both sides of the question, and should be glad if they
would point out to me the name of a Gipsy whom they could look up
to and consider as a good pattern for them to follow.&nbsp; Here
they began to scratch their heads, and said I had put them
&ldquo;a nightcap on.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon my soul,&rdquo;
said one, &ldquo;I should not know where to begin to look for
one,&rdquo; and then related to me the following
story:&mdash;&ldquo;The Devil sent word to some of his agents for
them to send him the worst man they could find upon the face of
the earth.&nbsp; So news went about among various societies
everywhere, consultations and meetings were held, and it was
decided that a Gipsy should be sent, as none of the societies or
agents could find one bad enough.&nbsp; Accordingly a passport
was procured, and they started the Gipsy on his way.&nbsp; When
he came to the door of hell he knocked for admittance.&nbsp; The
Devil shouted out, &lsquo;Who is there?&rsquo;&nbsp; The Gipsy
cried out, &lsquo;A Gipsy.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;All right,&rsquo;
said the Devil; &lsquo;you are just the man I am wanting.&nbsp; I
have been on the look-out for you some time.&nbsp; Come in.&nbsp;
I have been told the Gipsies are the worst folks in all the
world.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Gipsy had not been long in hell before
the Devil perceived that he was too bad for his place, and the
place began to swarm with young imps to such a degree that the
Devil called the Gipsy to him one day, and said, &lsquo;Of all
the people that have ever come to this place you are the
worst.&nbsp; You are too bad for us.&nbsp; Here is your
passport.&nbsp; Be off back again!&rsquo;&nbsp; The Devil opened
the door, and said, as the Gipsy was going, &lsquo;Make yourself
scarce.&rsquo;&nbsp; So you see,&rdquo; said Lee to me, &ldquo;we
are too bad for the Devil.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll go anywhere, fight
anybody, or do anything.&nbsp; Now, lads, drink that
&lsquo;fourpenny&rsquo; up, and let&rsquo;s send for some
more.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is Gipsy life in England on a Sunday
afternoon within the sound of church bells.</p>

<p>The proprietor of the <i>Weekly Times</i> very readily granted
permission for one of the principals of his staff to accompany me
to one of the Gipsy encampments a Sunday or two ago <!-- page
223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>on
the outskirts of London.&nbsp; Those who know the writer would
say the article is truthful, and not in the least
overdrawn:&mdash;&ldquo;The lane was full of decent-looking
houses, tenanted by labourers in foundries and gas and
waterworks; but there were spaces between the rows of houses,
forming yards for the deposit of garbage, and in these unsavoury
spots the Gipsies had drawn up their caravans, and pitched their
smoke-blackened tents.&nbsp; These yards were separated from each
other by rows of cottages, and each yard contained families
related near or distantly, or interested in each other&rsquo;s
welfare by long associations in the country during summer time,
and in such places as we found them during the winter
season.&nbsp; After spending several hours with these people in
their tents and caravans, and passing from yard to yard, asking
the talkative ones questions, we came to the conclusion that, in
the whole bounds of this great metropolis, it would have been
impossible to have found any miscalling themselves Gipsies whose
mode of living more urgently called for the remedial action of
the law than the tenants of Lamb-lane.&nbsp; In the first place,
there was not a true Gipsy amongst them; nor one man, woman, or
child who could in any degree claim relationship with a
Gipsy.&nbsp; They were, all of them, idle loafers, who had
adopted the wandering life of the Gipsy because of the
opportunities it afforded of combining a maximum of idle hours
with a minimum of work.&nbsp; The men exhibited this in their
countenances, in the attitudes they took up, by the whining drawl
with which they spoke; the women, by their dirtiness and
inattention to dress; and the children, by their filthy
condition.&nbsp; The men and women had fled from the restraints
of house life to escape the daily routine which a home involved;
the men had no higher ambition than to obtain a small sum of
money on the Saturday to pay for a few days&rsquo; food.&nbsp;
There was not one man amongst them who could solder a broken
kettle; a few, however, could mend a chair bottom, but there all
industrial ability ended; and the <!-- page 224--><a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>others got
their living by shaving skewers from Monday morning to Friday
night, which were sold to butchers at 10d. or 1s. the
stone.&nbsp; These men stayed at home, working over the brazier
of burning coke during the week, while their wives hawked small
wool mats or vases, but nothing of their own manufacture; and the
grown-up lads, on market-days, added to the general industry by
buying flowers in Covent-garden, and hawking them in the suburbs
of the metropolis.&nbsp; We were assured by Mr. Smith that this
class of pseudo-Gipsy was largely on the increase, and to check
their spread Mr. Smith suggests that the provisions of an Act of
Parliament should be mainly directed.&nbsp; Only one of all we
saw and spoke to on Sunday was &lsquo;a scholar&rsquo;&mdash;that
is, could read at all&mdash;and this was a lad of about fourteen,
who had spent a few hours occasionally at a Board school.&nbsp;
With all the others the knowledge that comes of reading was an
absolute blank.&nbsp; They knew nothing, except that the proceeds
of the previous week had been below the average; social events of
surpassing interest had not reached them, and the future was
limited by &lsquo;to-morrow.&rsquo;&nbsp; We questioned them upon
their experiences of the past winter, and the preference they had
for their tents over houses was emphatically marked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Brick houses,&rsquo; said one woman, who was suckling a
baby, &lsquo;are so full of draughts.&rsquo;&nbsp; Night and day
the brazier of burning coke was never allowed to go low, and
under the tent the ground was always dry, however wet it might be
outside, because of the heat from the brazier; besides, they lay
upon well-trodden-down straw, six or eight inches deep, and
covered themselves with their clothes, their wraps, their filthy
rugs, and tattered rags, and were as warm as possible.&nbsp; The
tents had many advantages over a brick house.&nbsp; Besides
having no draughts, there was no accumulation of snow upon the
tops of the tents; and so these witless people were content to
endure poverty, hunger, cold, and dirt for the sake of minimising
their contribution to the general good of the whole
commonwealth.&nbsp; The poorest working man in <!-- page 225--><a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>London who
does an honest week&rsquo;s work is a hero compared with such men
as these.&nbsp; It would be impossible to nurture sentiment in
any tent in Lamb-lane.&nbsp; There was no face with a glimmer of
honest self-reliance about it, no face bearing any trace of the
strange beauty we had noticed in other encampments, and no form
possessed of any distinguishing grace.&nbsp; The whole of the
yards were redolent of dirt; and the people, each and all,
inexcusably foul in person.&nbsp; In several yards little boys or
girls sat on the ground in the open air, tending coke fires over
which stood iron pots, and, as the water boiled and raised the
lids, it was plain that the women were taking advantage of the
quiet hours of the afternoon for a wash.&nbsp; Before we came
away from the last yard, lines had been strung across all the
yards, and the hastily-washed linen rags were fluttering in the
air.&nbsp; One tent was closed to visitors.&nbsp; It was then
four o&rsquo;clock, and a woman told us confidentially her friend
was washing a blanket, which she would have to dry that same
afternoon, as it would be &lsquo;wanted&rsquo; at night; but
&lsquo;the friend&rsquo; professed her readiness to take charge
of anything we had to spare for the washerwoman&mdash;a mouthful
of baccy, a &lsquo;sucker&rsquo; for the baby, or &lsquo;three
ha&rsquo;pence for a cup of tea.&rsquo;&nbsp; Boys were there of
fourteen and sixteen, with great rents in the knees of their
corduroys, who only went out to hawk one day in the
week&mdash;Saturday.&nbsp; They started with a light truck for
Covent-garden at four in the morning, and would have from 4s. to
6s. to lay out in flowers.&nbsp; When questioned as to what
flowers they had bought on the previous day, one lad said they
were &lsquo;tulips, hyacinths, and cyclaments,&rsquo; but nobody
could give us an intelligible description of the last-named
flowers.&nbsp; Two lads generally took charge of the flower
truck, and the result of the day&rsquo;s hawking was usually a
profit of half-a-crown to three shillings.&nbsp; These lads also
assisted during the week in shaving skewers, and accompanied
their fathers to market when they had a load to sell.&nbsp; In
one tent we found a dandy-hen sitting; she had been so <!-- page
226--><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>occupied one week, and the presence of the children and
adults, who shared her straw bed, in no way discomposed
her.&nbsp; We found that baccy and &lsquo;suckers&rsquo; were the
most negotiable exchanges with these people.&nbsp; The women,
young and old, small boys and the men, all smoked, and the day
became historic with them because, of the extra smokes they were
able to have.&nbsp; The &lsquo;suckers&rsquo; were the largest
specimen of &lsquo;bulls&rsquo; eyes&rsquo; we could
find&mdash;not those dainty specimens sold at the West-end or in
the Strand, but real whoppers, almost the size of pigeons&rsquo;
eggs; and yet there was no baby whose mouth was not found equal
to the reception and the hiding of the largest; and we noticed as
a strange psychological fact that no baby would consent, though
earnestly entreated by its mother, to suffer the
&lsquo;sucker&rsquo; to leave its mouth for the mother to look
at.&nbsp; The babies knew better, shaking their wary little heads
at their mothers.&nbsp; Instinct was stronger than
obedience.&nbsp; We were not sorry to get away from Lamb-lane,
with its filthy habitations, blanket washings, ragged boys and
girls, lazy men and women.&nbsp; For the genuine Gipsy tribe, and
their mysterious promptings to live apart from their fellows in
the lanes and fields of the country, we have a sentimental pity;
but with such as these Lamb-lane people, off-scourings of the
lowest form of society, we have no manner of sympathy; and we
hope that a gracious Act of Parliament may soon rid English
social life of such a plague, and teach such people their duty to
their children and to society at large&mdash;things they are too
ignorant and too idle to learn for themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My son sends me the following account of a visit he made to a
Gipsy encampment near London:&mdash;I visited the camp at Barking
Road this afternoon.&nbsp; Possibly you thought I might not go if
you gave me a correct description of the route, for I certainly
went through more muddy streets and over lock-bridges than your
instructions mentioned.&nbsp; Presuming I was near the camp, I
inquired of a policeman, and was surprised with the reply that
there used to be one, but <!-- page 227--><a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>he had not
heard anything of it for a long while.&nbsp; His mind was
evidently wandering, or else he meant it as a joke, for we were
then standing within three hundred yards of the largest
encampment I have yet seen.&nbsp; It is situated at the back of
Barking Road, in what may be termed a field, but it certainly is
not a green one, for the only horse and donkey that I saw were
standing against boxes eating&mdash;perhaps corn.</p>
<p>I am surprised that the Gipsies should choose such an exposed,
damp place for camping-ground, as it is always partly under
water, and the only shelter afforded being a few houses at the
back and one side; the rest faces, and is consequently exposed
to, the bleak winds blowing over the marsh and the river.</p>
<p>At the entrance I was met by a poor woman taking a child to
the doctor, her chief dread being that if she did not the law
would be down upon her.&nbsp; She had put the journey off to the
last minute, for the poor thing looked nearly dead then.</p>
<p>Once in the camp one could not but notice the miserable
appearance of the place.&nbsp; Women and children, not one of
whom could read and write, with scarcely any clothing, the latter
without shoes or stockings.&nbsp; Twenty to twenty-five old,
ragged, and dirty tents&mdash;not canvas, but old, worn-out
blankets&mdash;separated by the remains of old broken vans,
buckets, and rubbish that must have taken years to
accumulate.&nbsp; Everything betokened age and poverty.&nbsp;
Evidently this field has been a camping-ground for some
years.&nbsp; Three old vans were all the place could boast of,
and one of those was made out of a two-wheeled cart.</p>
<p>I was for the first ten minutes fully occupied in trying to
keep a respectable distance from a number of dogs of all sizes
and breeds, which had the usual appetite for fresh meat and tweed
trowsering, and, at the same time, endeavouring in vain to find
solid ground upon which to stand, for the place at the entrance
and all round the tents was one regular mass of deep
&ldquo;slush.&rdquo;&nbsp; It soon became known that my <!-- page
228--><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>pockets were plentifully supplied with half-ounces of
tobacco and sweets.&nbsp; These I soon disposed off, especially
the latter, for there seemed no end to the little bare-footed
children that could walk, and those that couldn&rsquo;t were
brought in turn by their sisters or brothers.&nbsp; I was invited
to visit all the tents, but I could gain but little information
beyond an account of the severe winter, bad state of trade, your
visit in one of the black, dense fogs, &amp;c.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The men followed the occupation of either tinkers or
peg-makers, and all the young women will pull out their pipe and
ask for tobacco as readily as the old ones.</p>
<p>The camp is one of the Lees.&nbsp; The majority of the men,
women, and children are of light complexion, and, as for a
dark-eyed beauty, one was not to be found.&nbsp; I stayed most of
the time under the &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; of the old man, Thomas
Lee, who is a jolly old fellow about sixty, and the father of
eleven young children.&nbsp; He was evidently the life of the
camp, for they all flock round his tent to hear his interesting
snatches of song and story.</p>
<p>He had heard that Her Majesty had sent &pound;50 to assist you
in getting the children educated, and just before I left I was
pleased to hear him give vent to his feelings with the rough but
patriotic speech that &ldquo;She was a rare good woman, and a
Queen of the right sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must not be inferred from what I have said, or shall say,
that there are no good Gipsies among them.&nbsp; Here and there
are females to be found ready at all hours and on all occasions
to do good both to the souls and bodies of Gipsies and
house-dwellers as they travel with their basket from door to door
hawking their wares; and to illustrate the truth of this I cannot
do better than refer to the case of the good and kind-hearted
Mrs. Simpson, who is generally located with her husband and some
grand-children in her van in the neighbourhood near Notting Hill,
on the outskirts of London.&nbsp; Mrs. Simpson tells me that she
is not a thorough Gipsy, only a half one.&nbsp; Her father was
<!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>one of the rare old Gipsy family of Lees, of Norfolk,
and her mother was a Gorgio or Gentile, who preferred following
the &ldquo;witching eye&rdquo; and &ldquo;black locks&rdquo; to
the rag and stick hovel&mdash;or, to be more aristocratic,
&ldquo;the tent&rdquo;&mdash;whose roof and sides consisted of
sticks and canvas, with an opening in the roof to serve as a
chimney, through which the smoke arising from the hearth-stick
fire could pass, excepting that which settled on the hands and
face.&nbsp; Grass, green, decayed, or otherwise, to serve as a
carpet, the brown trampled turf taking the place of mosaic and
encaustic tile pavements, straw instead of a feather-bed, and a
soap-box, tea-chest, and like things doing duty as drawing-room
furniture.&nbsp; Mrs. Simpson, when quite a child, was always
reckoned most clever in the art of deception, telling lies and
fortunes out of a small black Testament, of which she could not
read a sentence or tell a letter; sometimes reading the planets
of silly geese, simpletons, and fools out of it when it was
upside down, and when detected she was always ready with a
plausible excuse, which they, with open mouths, always swallowed
as Gospel; and for more than twenty-five years she kept herself
and family in this way with sufficient money to keep them in
luxury, loose living, and idleness, till the year of 1859, when,
by some unaccountable means, her conscience, which, up to this
time, had been insensible, dull, and without feeling, became
awakened, sharp, and alive.&nbsp; Probably this quickening took
place in consequence of her hearing a good Methodist minister in
a mission-room in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The result was that
the money she took by telling fortunes began to burn her fingers,
and to make it sit upon her conscience as easy as possible she
had a large pocket made in her dress so that she could drop it in
without much handling.&nbsp; It was no easy thing to give up such
an easy way of getting a living to face the realities of an
honest pedlar&rsquo;s life, in the midst of &ldquo;slamming of
doors,&rdquo; &ldquo;cold-shoulders,&rdquo; &ldquo;scowls,&rdquo;
&ldquo;frowns,&rdquo; and insults; and a woman with less
determination of character would never <!-- page 230--><a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>have
attempted it&mdash;or, at least, if attempted, it would soon have
been given up on account of the insurmountable difficulties
surrounding it.&nbsp; Many times she has sat by the wayside with
her basket, after walking and toiling all day, and not having
taken a penny with which to provide the Sunday&rsquo;s dinner,
when at the last extremity Providence has opened her way and
friends have appeared upon the scene, and she has been enabled to
&ldquo;go on her way rejoicing,&rdquo; and for the last twenty
years she has been trying to do all the good she can, and to day
she is not one penny the loser, but, on the other hand, a gainer,
by following such a course.&nbsp; Personally, I have received
much encouragement and valuable information at her hands to help
me in my work to do the Gipsy children good in one form or
other.&nbsp; I have frequently called to see the grand old Gipsy
woman, sometimes unexpectedly, and when I have done so I have
either found her reading the Bible or else it has been close to
her elbow.&nbsp; Its stains and soils betoken much wear and
constant use.&nbsp; Very different to the old woman who put her
spectacles into her Bible as she set it upon the clock, and lost
them for more than seven years.&nbsp; She is a firm believer in
prayer; in fact, it seems the very essence of her life, and she
can relate numbers of instances when and where God has answered
her petitions.&nbsp; On her bed-quilt are the following texts of
scripture, poetry, &amp;c., which, as she says, these, with other
portions of God&rsquo;s word, she &ldquo;has learnt to read
without any other aid except His Holy
Spirit:&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;For God so loved the world that He
gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth on Him should
not perish but have everlasting life.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Every
kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and a
house divided against a house falleth.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But
whoso hath this world&rsquo;s goods and seeth his brother have
need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how
dwelleth the love of God in him?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All things
whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall
receive.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not
want.&nbsp; <!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>He maketh me to lie down in green
pastures, He leadeth me beside the still waters.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
death I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me, Thy rod and Thy
staff they comfort me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the door; by Me
if any man enter in he shall be saved, and shall go in and out
and find pasture.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let nothing be done through
strife, but in lowliness of mind; let each esteem others better
than themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Look not every man on his
own things, but every man also on the things of
others.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let your speech be always with grace,
seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wives submit yourselves unto your
husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Husbands
love your own wives and be not bitter against them.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Children obey your parents in all things, for this is well
pleasing unto the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Fathers provoke not
your children to anger lest they be discouraged.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Servants obey in all things your masters according to the
flesh, not with eye service as man pleases, but in singleness of
heart fearing God.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The fruit of the spirit is
love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,&rdquo;
&amp;c.&nbsp; &ldquo;The wages of sin is death.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let us run the race with patience.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Judge not, that ye be not judged.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even
so to them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He that cometh unto Me I will in
no wise cast out.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come unto Me all ye that
labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am the way, the truth, and the life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whatsoever ye find to do, do it with all your
might.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And God shall wipe away all tears from
their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor
crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former
things are passed away.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He that overcometh
shall inherit all things; and I will be his God and he shall be
My son.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And they shall see His face and His
name shall be in their foreheads.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And there
shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light
of the sun, for the Lord God giveth them light, and they shall
reign for ever and ever.&rdquo;</p>

and consolation, she has many times rested her wearied body after
returning from her day&rsquo;s trudging and toil, and under these
she has slept peacefully as in the arms of death, ready to answer
the Master&rsquo;s summons, and to meet with her dear little boy
who has crossed the river, <!-- page 233--><a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>when He
shall say, &ldquo;It is enough; come up hither,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;sit on My throne.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although she is a big,
powerful woman, and has been more so in years that are past, when
any one begins to talk about Heaven and the happiness and joy in
reserve for those who have a hope of meeting with loved ones
again, when the cares and anxieties of life are ended, it is not
long before they see big, scalding, briny tears rolling down her
dark, Gipsy-coloured face, and she will frequently edge in words
during the conversation about her &ldquo;Dear Saviour&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Blessed Lord and Master.&rdquo;&nbsp; I may mention the
names of other warm-hearted Gipsies who are trying to improve the
condition of some of the adult portion of their brethren and
sisters&mdash;dwellers upon the turf, and clod scratchers, who
feed many of their poor women and children upon cabbage broth and
turnip sauce, and &ldquo;bed them down,&rdquo; after kicks,
blows, and ill-usage, upon rotten straw strewn upon the damp
ground.&nbsp; Mrs. Carey, Mr. and Mrs. Eastwood, Mrs. Hedges, and
the three Gipsy brothers Smith, Mrs. Lee, and a few others, have
not laboured without some success, at the same time they are
powerless to improve the condition of the future generations of
Gipsy women and children, young mongrels and hut-dwelling
Gorgios, by applying the civilising influences of education and
sanitary measures to banish heathenism worse than that of Africa,
idleness, immorality, thieving, lying, and deception of the
deepest dye from our midst, as exhibited in the dwellings of the
rag and stick hovels to be seen flitting about the outskirts,
fringe, and scum of our own neglected ragamuffin population,
roaming about under the cognition that the name of a Gipsy is
nauseous and disgusting in most people&rsquo;s mouths on account
of the damning evil practices they have followed and carried out
for centuries upon the honest and industrious artisans,
tradesmen, and others they have been brought in contact
with.&nbsp; A raw-boned Gipsy, with low, slanting forehead,
deep-set eyes, large eyebrows, thick lips, wide mouth, skulkingly
slow gait, slouched hat, and a large <!-- page 234--><a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>grizzly-coloured dog at his heels, in a dark, narrow
lane, on a starlight night, is not a pleasant state of things for
a timid and nervous man to grapple with; nevertheless this is one
side of a Gipsy&rsquo;s life as he goes prowling about in quest
of his prey, and as such it is seen by those who know something
of Gipsy life.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And they return at evening: they growl like
a dog and compass the city;<br />

<p>Even my friends, the canal-boatmen, look upon Gipsies as the
lowest of the low, and lower down the social scale than any
boatman to be met with.&nbsp; Some of them have gone so far as to
try to shake my nerves by telling me that, now I had taken the
Gipsy women and children in hand, they would not give sixpence
for my life.&nbsp; I could only reply with a smile, and tell them
that I was in safe keeping till the work was done, as in the case
of the canal movement.&nbsp; Frowns, dogs, sticks, stones, and
oaths did not frighten me.&nbsp; The time had arrived when the
vagabondish life of a Gipsy&mdash;so called&mdash;should be
unmasked and the plain truth made known; and for this the Gipsies
will thank me, if they take into consideration the object I have
in view and the end I am seeking.&nbsp; My object is to elevate
them, through the instrumentality of sanitary officer and
schoolmaster being at work among the children, into respectable
citizens of society, earning an honest livelihood by honourable
and legitimate means; far better to do this than to go sneaking
about the country, begging, cadging, lying, and stealing all they
can lay their hands upon, and training their children to put up
with the scoffs, sneers, and insults of the Gorgios or Gentiles
for the sake of pocketing a penny at the cost of losing their
manhood.&nbsp; A thousand times better live a life such as would
enable them to look <!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>everybody straight in the face than
burrowing and scratching their way into the ground, making
skewers at one shilling per stone, and being considered as
outlaws, having the mark of Cain upon their forehead, with their
hands against everybody and everybody against them.&nbsp; There
is no honour in a scamp&rsquo;s life, credit in being a thief,
glory surrounding a rogue, and halo over the life of a vagabond
and a tramp.&nbsp; To see a half-naked, full grown-man and his
wife, with six or eight children, sitting on the damp ground in
rag huts large enough only for a litter of pigs, scratching
roasted potatoes out of the dying embers of a coke fire, as
thousands are doing to-day, is enough to freeze the blood in
one&rsquo;s veins, make one utter a shriek of horror and despair,
and to bring down the wrath of God upon the country that allows
such a state of things in her midst.</p>

The sad Condition of the Gipsies, with Suggestions for their
Improvement.</h2>
<p>One thing that strikes me in going through the writings of
those authors in this country who have endeavoured to deal with
the Gipsy question is, their hesitation to tackle the Gipsy
difficulty at home.&nbsp; On the surface of the books they have
written there appears a disposition to mince the subject, at all
events, that amount of courage has not been put into their works
that characterised Grellmann&rsquo;s work upon the Gipsies of his
own country.&nbsp; If an account similar to Grellmann&rsquo;s had
appeared concerning our English Gipsies a century ago, and
energetic action had been taken by our law-makers, instead of
publishing an account of the Hungarian and other Continental
Gipsies, it is impossible to calculate the beneficent results
that would have accrued long before this, both to the Gipsies
themselves and the country at large.</p>

<p>One writer deals principally with the Scotch Gipsies, another
with the Spanish Gipsies, another is trying to prove the Egyptian
origin of the Gipsies, another is tracing their language, another
treats upon our English Gipsies in a kind of
&ldquo;milk-and-watery&rdquo; fashion that will neither do them
good nor harm&mdash;he pleases his readers, but leaves the
Gipsies where he found them, viz., in the ditch.&nbsp; Another
went to work on the principle of praying and believing for them;
but, I am sorry to say, in his circumscribed sphere his faith and
works fell flat, on account, no doubt, of this dear, good <!--

237</span>man and his friends undertaking to do a work which
should in that day have been undertaken by the State, at least,
that part of it relating to the education of the Gipsy
children.</p>
<p>The Gipsy race is supposed to be the most beautiful in the
world, and amongst the Russian Gipsies are to be found
countenances, which, to do justice to, would require an abler pen
than mine; but exposure to the rays of the sun, the biting of the
frost, and the pelting of the pitiless sleet and snow destroys
the beauty at a very early age, and if in infancy their personal
advantages are remarkable, their ugliness at an advanced age is
no less so, for then it is loathsome and
appalling:&mdash;&ldquo;He wanted but the dark and kingly crown
to have represented the monster who opposed the progress of
Lucifer whilst careering in burning arms and infernal glory to
the outlet of his hellish prison.&rdquo;&nbsp; In our own country
a number of Gipsies sit as models, for which they get one
shilling per hour.&nbsp; They are not in demand as perfect
specimens of the human figure from the crown of the head to the
sole of the foot; but few of them, owing to their low, debasing
habits, have arrived at that state of perfection.&nbsp; I know
one real, fine, old Gipsy woman who sits to artists for the back
of her head only, on account of her black, frizzy, raven
locks.&nbsp; One will sit for her eyes, another for the nose,
another for the hands and feet, another for the colour
only.&nbsp; Alfred Smith sits for his feet, and there are others
who sit for their legs and arms.&nbsp; No class of people, owing
to their mixture with other classes, tribes, and nations,
presents a greater variety of models for the artist than the
Gipsy.&nbsp; If an artist wants to paint a thief he can find a
model among the Gipsies.&nbsp; If he wants to paint a dark
highwayman lurking behind a hedge after his prey he goes to the
Gipsy.&nbsp; If he wants to paint Ajax he goes to the
Gipsy.&nbsp; If he wants to paint a Grecian, Roman, or Spaniard
he goes to the Gipsy.&nbsp; Of course there are exceptions, but
if an artist wants to paint a large, fine, intellectual-looking
figure, with an open countenance, he <!-- page 238--><a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>keeps away
from the Gipsies and seeks his models elsewhere.&nbsp; Dregs
among the Gipsies have produced queens for the artists.</p>
<p>Gipsies with a mixture of English blood in their veins have
produced men with pluck, courage, and stamina, strongly built,
with plenty of muscle and bone.&nbsp; Two &ldquo;bruisers&rdquo;
of the Gipsy vagabond class have worn the champion&rsquo;s belt
of the world; and, on the other hand, this mixture of English and
Gipsy blood has produced some fine delicate Grecian forms of
female beauty, dove-like, soft in eye, hand, and heart&mdash;the
flashy fire in the eye of a Gipsy has been reduced to the modesty
and innocence and simplicity of a child.&nbsp; Our present race
of Gipsies, under the influence of education, refinement, and
religion, will, if properly and wisely taken in hand and dealt
with according to the light of reason and truth, produce a class
of men and women well qualified to take their share, for weal or
for woe, in the struggle of life.</p>
<p>Some first-rate songsters and musicians have been produced
among the Gipsies, and whose merits have been acknowledged.&nbsp;
Perhaps the highest compliment ever paid to a singer was paid by
Catalini herself to one of the daughters of a tanned and tawny
skin.&nbsp; It is well known in Russia that the celebrated
Italian was so enchanted with the voice of a Moscow Gipsy (who,
after the former had displayed her noble talent before a splendid
audience in the old Russian capital, stepped forward and poured
forth one of her national strains) that she tore from her own
shoulders a shawl of cashmere which had been presented to her by
the Pope, and, embracing the Gipsy, insisted on her acceptance of
the splendid gift, saying that it was intended for the matchless
songster, which she now perceived she herself was not.&nbsp; No
doubt there are many good voices among our Gipsies; what is
required to bring them out is education and culture.&nbsp; Our
best Gipsy songsters and musicians are in Wales.</p>
<p><!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>The following is a specimen of a Gipsy poetic effusion,
which my Gipsy admirers will not consider an extraordinarily
high-flown production&mdash;the outcome of nearly one million
Gipsies who have wandered up and down Europe for more than three
hundred years, as related by Borrow.</p>
<h3>TWO GIPSIES.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Two Gipsy lads were transported,<br />
Were sent across the great water;<br />
Plato was sent for rioting,<br />
And Louis for stealing the purse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of a great lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when they came to the other country,<br />
The country that lies across the water,<br />
Plato was speedily hung,<br />
But Louis was taken as a husband<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By a great lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wish to know who was the lady:<br />
&rsquo;Twas the lady from whom he stole the purse;<br />
The Gipsy had a black and witching eye,<br />
And on account of that she followed him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the great water.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smart and Crofton, speaking poetically and romantically of
Gipsy life, say as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the first spring sunshine comes the old longing to
be off, and soon is seen, issuing from his winter quarters, a
little cavalcade, tilted cart, bag and baggage, donkeys and dogs,
rom, romni, and tickni, chavis, and the happy family is once more
under weigh for the open country.&nbsp; With dark, restless eye
and coarse, black hair fluttered by the breeze, he slouches
along, singing as he goes, in heart, if not in precise
words&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I loiter down by thorpe and town,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For any job I&rsquo;m willing;<br />
Take here and there a dusty brown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And here and there a shilling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No carpet can please him like the soft green turf, and no <!--
page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>curtains compare with the snow-white blossoming
hedgerow thereon.&nbsp; A child of Nature, he loves to repose on
the bare breast of the great mother.&nbsp; As the smoke of his
evening fire goes up to heaven, and the savoury odour of roast
hotchi witchi or of canengri soup salutes his nostrils, he sits
in the deepening twilight drinking in with unconscious delight
all the sights and sounds which the country affords; with his
keen senses alive to every external impression he feels that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis sweet to see the evening star
appear,<br />
&rsquo;Tis sweet to listen as the night winds creep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From leaf to leaf.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He dreamily hears the distant bark of the prowling fox, and
the melancholy hootings of the wood owls; he marks the shriek of
the night-wandering weasel, and the rustle of the bushes as some
startled forest creature darts into deep coverts; or, perchance,
the faint sounds from a sequestered hamlet of a great city.&nbsp;
Cradled from infancy in such haunts as these &lsquo;places of
nestling green for poets made,&rsquo; and surely for Gipsies too,
no wonder if, after the fitful fever of town life, he sleeps
well, with the unforgotten and dearly-loved lullabies of his
childhood soothing him to rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following is in their own Gipsy language to each other,
and exhibits a true type of the feeling of revenge they foster to
one another for wrongs done and injuries received, and may be
considered a fair specimen of the disposition of thousands of
Gipsies in our midst:&mdash;&ldquo;Just see, mates, what a
blackguard he is.&nbsp; He has been telling wicked lies about us,
the cursed dog.&nbsp; I will murder him when I get hold of
him.&nbsp; That creature, his wife, is just as bad.&nbsp; She is
worse than he.&nbsp; Let us thrash them both and drive them out
of our society, and not let them come near us, such cut-throats
and informers as they are.&nbsp; They are nothing but
murderers.&nbsp; They are informers.&nbsp; We shall all come to
grief through their misdoings.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not <!-- page
241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>much poetry and romance in language and characters of
this description.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These Indians ne&rsquo;er forget<br />
Nor evermore forgive an injury.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following is a wail of their own, taken from Smart and
Crofton, and will show that the Gipsies themselves do not think
tent life is so delightful, happy, and free as has been pictured
in the imaginative brain of novel writers, whose knowledge has
been gained by visiting the Gipsies as they have basked on the
grassy banks on a hot summer day, surrounded by the warbling
songsters and rippling brooks of water, as clear as crystal, at
their feet, sending forth dribbling sounds of enchantment to fall
upon musical ears, touching the cords of poetic affection and
lyric sympathy:&mdash;&ldquo;Now, mates, be quick.&nbsp; Put your
tent up.&nbsp; Much rain will come down, and snow, too&mdash;we
shall all die to-night of cold; and bring something to make a
good fire, too.&nbsp; Put the tent down well, much wind will come
this night.&nbsp; My children will die of cold.&nbsp; Put all the
rods in the ground properly to make it stand well.&nbsp; The poor
children cry for food.&nbsp; My God! what shall I do to give them
food to eat?&nbsp; I have nothing to give them.&nbsp; They will
die without food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My object in this part will be to deal with the Gipsy question
in a hard, matter of fact way, both as regards their present
condition and the only remedy by which they are to be
improved.&nbsp; No one believes in the power of the Gospel more
than I do as to its being able to rescue the very dregs of
society from misery and wretchedness; but in the case of the
Gipsies and canal-boatmen they cannot be got together so as to be
brought under its influence.&nbsp; Their darkness, ignorance, and
flitting habits, prevent them either reading about Jesus or being
brought within the magic spell of the Gospel.&nbsp; When once the
Gipsy children have learned to read and write I shall then have
more faith in the power of God&rsquo;s truth reaching the hearts
of the Gipsies and producing better results.</p>
<p><!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>The following letter has been handed to me by the
uncle, to show what a little, dark-eyed Gipsy girl of twelve
years of age can do.&nbsp; Notwithstanding all its faults it is a
credit to the little beauty, especially if it is taken into
consideration that she has had no father to teach her, and she
has chiefly been her own schoolmaster and mistress.&nbsp; She is
the only one who can read and write in a large family.&nbsp; Her
books have been sign-boards, guide-posts, and mile-stones, and
her light the red glare of a coke fire.&nbsp; I give the letter
to show two things; first, that there is a strong desire among
the poor Gipsy children for education; second, that there is that
mental calibre about the Gipsy children of the present generation
that only requires fostering, handling, educating, and caring for
as other children are to produce in the next generation a class
of people of whom no country need be ashamed.&nbsp; They will be
equal to stand shoulder to shoulder with other labouring
classes.</p>

<p>In speaking of the Gipsies in Scotland sixty years ago, Mr.
Deputy-Sheriff Moor, of Aberdeenshire, says as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Occasionally vagrants, both single and in
bands, appear in this part of the country, resorting to fairs,
when they commit depredations on the unwary.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir
Walter Scott, Bart., says of the Gipsies:&mdash;&ldquo;A set of
people possessing the same erratic habits, and practising the
trade of tinkers, are well known in the Borders, and have often
fallen under the cognisance of the law.&nbsp; They are often
called Gipsies, and pass through the country annually in small
bands, with their carts and asses.&nbsp; The men are tinkers,
poachers, and thieves upon a small scale,&rdquo; and he goes on
to say that &ldquo;some of the more atrocious families have been
extirpated.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Riddell, Justice of Peace for
Roxburghshire, says:&mdash;&ldquo;They are thorough desperadoes
of the worst class of vagabonds.&nbsp; Those who travel through
this county give offence chiefly by poaching and small
thefts.&nbsp; All of them are perfectly ignorant of
religion.&nbsp; They marry and cohabit amongst each other, and
are held in a sort of horror by the common people.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. William Smith, the Baillie of Kelso, and a gentlemen of high
position, says:&mdash;&ldquo;Some kind of honour peculiar to
themselves seems to prevail in their community.&nbsp; They reckon
it a disgrace to steal near their homes, or even at a distance if
detected.&nbsp; I must always except that petty theft of feeding
their shilties and asses on the farmers&rsquo; grass and corn,
which they will do whether at home or abroad.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he
further says, &ldquo;I am sorry to say, however, that when
checked in their licentious appropriations they are much addicted
both to threaten and to <!-- page 244--><a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>execute
revenge.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Smith always visited the Gipsies upon
one of the estates of which he had the charge, consequently he
would be likely to know more about them than most people.&nbsp; A
number of other gentleman confirmed these statements.&nbsp; By
comparing these remarks with the statements of Mr. Harrison in a
letter published in the <i>Standard</i> last August, backing up
my case, it will be seen that the Scotch Gipsies if anything have
degenerated.&nbsp; Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s letter will be found in
Part II.</p>
<p>Much has been said and written with reference to their health
and age.&nbsp; For my own part I firmly believe that the great
ages to which they say they live&mdash;of course there are many
exceptions&mdash;are only myths and delusions, and another of
their dodges to excite sympathy.&nbsp; From the days of their
debauchery, and becoming what are termed under a respectable
phrase for Gipsies, &ldquo;old hags,&rdquo; they seem to jump
from sixty to between seventy and eighty at a bound.&nbsp; I was
talking to one I considered an old woman as to her age only a day
or two ago, and she said, with a pitiful tone, &ldquo;I am a long
way over seventy,&rdquo; and I asked her if she could tell me the
year in which she was born, to which she replied that she
&ldquo;was sixteen when the good Queen was crowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following case, related to me by the tradesman himself, at
Battersea&mdash;a sharp, quick, business gentleman, who boasted
to me that he had never been sold before by any one&mdash;will
show faintly how clever the Gipsy women are at lying, deception,
and cheating:&mdash;Three pretty, well-dressed Gipsy women went
into his shop one day last summer, and said that they had
arranged to have a christening on the morrow, and as beer got
into the heads of their men, and made them wild, which they did
not like to see on such occasions, they had decided to have a
quiet, little, respectable affair, and in place of beer they were
going to have wine, cakes, and biscuits after their tea; and they
ordered some currant cake, several bottles of wine, tea, sugar,
and other things required on such occasions, to the amount of two
pounds fourteen <!-- page 245--><a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>shillings.&nbsp; The Gipsies asked
to have the bill made out and the goods packed in a hamper.&nbsp;
And while this was being done the Gipsies said to the tradesman:
&ldquo;Now, as we have ordered so much from you, we think that
you ought to buy a mat or two and other things of
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without consulting his wife, he agreed to buy
one or two things, to the amount of eleven shillings, which the
tradesman had thought would have been deducted from their
account; but the Gipsies thought differently&mdash;and here was
the craft&mdash;and said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t understand
figures.&nbsp; You had better pay us for the mats, &amp;c., and
we will pay you for the wine.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tradesman, who was
thrown off his guard, paid them the eleven shillings.&nbsp; With
this they walked out of his shop, saying that they would take the
bill with them, and send a man with the money and a barrow for
the wine, cake, &amp;c., in a few minutes, which they did not,
but left the tradesman a wiser but sadder man for spending eleven
shillings in things he did not require; and his remarks to me
were, &ldquo;No more Gipsies for me, thank you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
had quite plenty of Gipsies for my lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cases have been known when the Gipsy women have gone among the
farmers&rsquo; cattle and rubbed their nostrils with some
nastiness to such an extent as to cause the cattle to loathe
their food.&nbsp; The Gipsy in the lane&mdash;who of course knows
all about the affair&mdash;goes to the farmer and tells him he
can cure his cattle.&nbsp; This is agreed upon.&nbsp; All the
Gipsy does is to visit the cattle secretly and slyly, and rub off
the nastiness he has put on.&nbsp; The cattle immediately begin
to eat their food, and the Gipsy gets his fee.&nbsp; They kill
lambs by sticking pins into their heads.</p>
<p>Tallemant says that near Peye, in Picardy, a Gipsy offered a
stolen sheep to a butcher for one hundred sous, or five francs;
but the butcher declined to give more than four francs for
it.&nbsp; The butcher then went away; whereupon the Gipsy pulled
the sheep from a sack into which he had put it, and substituted
for it a child belonging to his tribe.&nbsp; He then ran after
the butcher, and said, &ldquo;Give me <!-- page 246--><a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>five
francs, and you shall have the sack into the
bargain.&rdquo;&nbsp; The butcher paid him the money, and went
away.&nbsp; When he got home he opened the sack, and was much
astonished when he saw a little boy jump out of it, who in an
instant caught up the sack and ran off.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never was a
poor man so hoaxed as this butcher.&rdquo;&nbsp; When they want
to leave a place where they have been stopping they set out in an
opposite direction to that in their right course.&nbsp; The
Gipsies have a thousand other tricks&mdash;so says one of the
Gipsy fraternity named Pechou de Ruby.&nbsp; Paul Lacroix says
that when they take up their quarters in any village they steal
very little in its immediate vicinity, but in the neighbouring
parishes they rob and plunder in the most daring manner.&nbsp; If
they find a sum of money they give notice to the captain, and
make a rapid flight from the place.&nbsp; They make counterfeit
money, and put it into circulation.&nbsp; They play all sorts of
games; they buy all sorts of horses, whether sound or unsound,
provided they can manage to pay for them in their own base
coin.&nbsp; When they buy food, they pay for it in good money the
first time, as they are held in such distrust; but when they are
about to leave a neighbourhood they again buy something, for
which they tender false coin, receiving the change in good
money.&nbsp; In harvest time all doors are shut against them,
nevertheless they contrive, by means of picklocks and other
instruments, to effect an entrance into houses, when they steal
linen, clocks, silver, and any other movable article which they
can lay their hands upon.&nbsp; They give a strict account of
everything to their captain, who takes his share.&nbsp; They are
very clever in making a good bargain.&nbsp; When they know of a
rich merchant living in the place, they disguise themselves,
enter into communication with him, and swindle him, after which
they change their clothes, have their horses shod the reverse
way, and the shoes covered with some soft material, lest they
should be heard, and gallop away.&nbsp; Grellmann
says:&mdash;&ldquo;The miserable condition of the Gipsies may be
imagined <!-- page 247--><a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>from the following facts: many of
them, and especially the women, have been burned, by their own
request, in order to end their miserable existence; and we can
give the case of a Gipsy, who, having been arrested, flogged, and
conducted to the frontier, with the threat that if he re-appeared
in the country he would be hanged, resolutely returned after
three successive and similar threats at three different places,
and implored that the capital sentence might be carried out, in
order that he might be released from a life of such
misery.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he goes on to say that &ldquo;these
unfortunate people were not even looked upon as human beings, for
during a hunting party the huntsmen had no scruple whatever in
killing a Gipsy woman who was suckling her child, just as they
would have done any wild beast which came in their
way.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he further says that they received
&ldquo;into their ranks all those whose crime, the fear and
punishment of an uneasy conscience, or the charm of a roaming
life continually threw in their path; they made use of them
either to find their way into countries of which they were
ignorant, or to commit robberies which would otherwise have been
impracticable.&nbsp; They were not slow to form an alliance with
profligate characters, who sometimes worked in concert with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A century ago it was somewhat romantic, and answered very well
as a contrast to civilisation, to see a number of people moving
about the country, dressed in beaver hats and bonnets, scarlet
cloaks and hoods, short petticoats, velvet coats with silver
buttons, and a plentiful supply of gold rings.&nbsp; The novelty
of their person, with dark skin and eyes, black hair, and their
fortune-telling proclivities, and other odd curiosities and
eccentricities, answered well for a time as a kind of eye-blinder
to their little thefts and like things; but that day is
over.&nbsp; Their silver buttons are all gone to pot.&nbsp; Their
silk velvet coats, plush waistcoats, and diamond rings have
vanished, never more to return with their present course of life;
patched breeches, torn coats, slouched hats, and washed gold
rings have taken their <!-- page 248--><a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>places, and
ragged garments in place of silk dresses for the poor Gipsy
women.&nbsp; The Gipsy men &ldquo;lollock&rdquo; about, the women
tell fortunes, and the children gambol on the ditch banks with
impunity, nobody caring to interfere with them in any way.&nbsp;
This kind of thing, as regards dash and show, is to a great
extent passed, and those men who put on a show of work at all, it
is as a general thing at tinkering, chair-mending, peg-splitting,
skewer-making, and donkey buying.&nbsp; The men make the skewers
and sell them at prices varying from one shilling to two
shillings per stone; the wood for the skewers they do not always
buy.&nbsp; A friend of mine told me a couple of months since that
the Gipsies had broken down his fences with impunity, and had
taken five hundred young saplings out of his plantation for this
purpose.&nbsp; Chairs are bottomed at prices ranging from one
shilling and upwards.&nbsp; Some of them do scissor-grinding, for
which they charge exorbitant prices.&nbsp; Sir G. H. Beaumont,
Bart., of Coleorton Hall, told me very recently that one of the
Boswell gang had charged him two shillings for grinding one
knife.&nbsp; Some of the women, who are not good hands at
fortune-telling, sell artificial flowers, combs, brushes, lace,
&amp;c.&nbsp; The women who are good at fortune-telling can make
a good thing out of it, even at this late day, in the midst of so
much light and Christianity, and they carry it out very adroitly
and cleverly too.&nbsp; Two or three months ago I was invited by
some Gipsy friends to have tea with them on the outskirts of
London.&nbsp; They very kindly sent for twopenny worth of butter
for me, and allowed me the honour of using the only cup and
saucer, which they said were over one hundred years old.&nbsp;
The tea for the grown-up sons and daughters was handed round in
mugs, jugs, and basins.&nbsp; The good old man cut my bread and
butter with his dark coloured hands pretty thin, but the bread
for his sons and daughters was like pieces of bricks, which, with
pieces of bacon, he pitched at them without any ceremony, and as
they caught it they, although men and women, <!-- page 249--><a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>kept saying
&ldquo;Thank you, pa,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thank you, pa,&rdquo; and
down it went without either knives or forks, or very little
grinding.&nbsp; We were all sitting upon the floor, my table
being an undressed brick out of some old building, and it was
with some difficulty I could keep the pigs that were running
loose in the yard from taking a piece off my plate, but with a
pretty free use of my toe I kept sending the little grunters
squeaking away.&nbsp; After tea I felt a little curious to know
what was in the big old Gipsy dame&rsquo;s basket, for I had an
idea one or two hair-brushes, combs, laces, and other small
trifles which lay on the top of a small piece of oilcloth
covering the inside of the basket had, by their greasy
appearance, done duty for many a long day.&nbsp; I told the old
Gipsy dame that I was going home the next day, and should like to
take a little thing or two for my little ones at home, as having
been bought of a Gipsy woman near London.&nbsp; The sharp old
woman was not long in offering me one or two of her trifles that
lay on the top of her basket, but these I said were not so
suitable as I should like.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had she nothing more
suitable lower down as a small present?&rdquo;&nbsp; After a
little fumbling and flustering she began to see my motive, and
said, &ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; I see what you are after.&nbsp; I will
tell you the truth and show you all.&rdquo;&nbsp; She turned the
oilcloth off the basket, underneath of which were &ldquo;shank
ends&rdquo; of joints, ham-bones, pieces of bacon, and
crusts.&nbsp; &ldquo;These,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;have been
given to me by servant girls and others for telling their
fortunes, really lies, and I have brought them here for my
children to live upon, and this is how we live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortune-telling is a soul-crushing and deadly crying evil, and
it is far from being stamped out.&nbsp; A hawker&rsquo;s licence,
about the size of one of these pages, covers a life-time of sin
and iniquity in this respect.&nbsp; A basket with half-a-dozen
brushes, combs, laces, a piece of oilcloth, and a pocket Bible,
is all the stock-in-trade they require, and it will serve them
for a year.&nbsp; They generally prophecy good.&nbsp; Knowing the
readiest way <!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>to deceive, to a young lady they
describe a handsome gentleman as one she may be assured will be
her &ldquo;husband.&rdquo;&nbsp; To a youth they promise a pretty
lady with a large fortune.&nbsp; And thus suiting their deluding
speeches to the age, circumstances, anticipations, and prospects
of those who employ them, they seldom fail to please their
vanity, and often gain a rich reward for their fraud.</p>
<p>A young lady in Gloucestershire allowed herself to be deluded
by a Gipsy woman, of artful and insinuating address, to a very
great extent.&nbsp; This lady admired a young gentleman, and the
Gipsy promised that he would return her love.&nbsp; The lady gave
her all the plate in the house, and a gold chain and locket, with
no other security than a vain promise that they should be
restored at a given period.&nbsp; As might be expected, the
wicked woman was soon off with her booty, and the lady was
obliged to expose her folly.&nbsp; The property being too much to
lose, the woman was pursued and overtaken.&nbsp; She was found
washing her clothes in a Gipsy camp, with the gold chain about
her neck.&nbsp; She was taken up, but on restoring the articles
was allowed to escape.</p>
<p>The same woman afterwards persuaded a gentleman&rsquo;s groom
that she could put him in possession of a great sum of money if
he would first deposit with her all he then had.&nbsp; He gave
her five pounds and his watch, and borrowed for her ten more of
two of his friends.&nbsp; She engaged to meet him at midnight in
a certain place a mile from the town where he lived, and that he
there should dig up out of the ground a silver pot full of gold
covered with a clean napkin.&nbsp; He went with his pickaxe and
shovel at the appointed time to the supposed lucky spot, having
his confidence strengthened by a dream he happened to have about
money, which he considered a favourable omen of the wealth he was
soon to receive.&nbsp; Of course he met no Gipsy; she had fled
another way with the property she had so wickedly obtained.&nbsp;
While waiting her arrival a hare started suddenly from its
resting-place and so alarmed him that he as suddenly took <!--
page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>to his heels and made no stop till he reached his
master&rsquo;s house, where he awoke his fellow-servants and told
to them his disaster.</p>
<p>This woman, who made so many dupes, rode a good horse, and
dressed both gaily and expensively.&nbsp; One of her saddles cost
thirty pounds.&nbsp; It was literally studded with silver, for
she carried on it the emblems of her profession wrought in that
metal&mdash;namely, a half moon, seven stars, and the rising
sun.&nbsp; Poor woman! <i>her</i> sun is set.&nbsp; Her sins have
found her out.&nbsp; Fortune-tellers die hard without exception,
so I am told by the Gipsies themselves.</p>
<p>Some time ago a gentleman followed several Gipsy
families.&nbsp; Arriving at the place of their encampment his
first object was to gain their confidence.&nbsp; This was
accomplished; after which, to amuse their unexpected visitant,
they showed forth their night diversions in music and dancing;
likewise the means by which they obtained their livelihood, such
as tinkering, fortune-telling, and conjuring.&nbsp; That the
gentleman might be satisfied whether he had obtained their
confidence or not, he represented his dangerous situation, in the
midst of which they all with one voice cried, &ldquo;Sir, we
would kiss your feet rather than hurt you!&rdquo;&nbsp; After
manifesting a confidence in return, the master of this formidable
gang, about forty in number, was challenged by the gentleman for
a conjuring match.&nbsp; The challenge was instantly
accepted.&nbsp; The Gipsies placed themselves in a circular form,
and both being in the middle commenced with their conjuring
powers to the best advantage.&nbsp; At last the visitor proposed
the making of something out of nothing.&nbsp; This proposal was
accepted.&nbsp; A stone which never existed was to be created,
and appear in a certain form in the middle of a circle made on
the turf.&nbsp; The master of the gang commenced, and after much
stamping with his foot, and the gentleman warmly exhorting him to
cry aloud, like the roaring of a lion, he endeavoured to call
forth nonentity into existence.&nbsp; Asking him if he could do
it, he answered, &ldquo;I am not strong <!-- page 252--><a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were all asked the same
question, which received the same answer.&nbsp; The visitor
commenced.&nbsp; Every eye was fixed upon him, eager to behold
this unheard-of exploit; but (and not to be wondered at) he
failed! telling them he possessed no more power to create than
themselves.&nbsp; Perceiving the thought of insufficiency
pervading their minds, he thus spoke: &ldquo;Now, if you have not
power to create a poor little stone, and if 1 have not power
either, what must that power be which made the whole world out of
nothing?&mdash;men, women, and children! that power I call God
Almighty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have been told that the dislike they have to rule and order
has led many of them to maim themselves by cutting off a finger,
that they might not serve in either the army or the navy; and I
believe there is one instance known of some Gipsies murdering a
witness who was to appear against some of their people for
horse-stealing; the persons who were guilty of the deed are dead,
and in their last moments exclaimed with horror and despair,
&ldquo;Murder, murder.&rdquo;&nbsp; But these circumstances do
not stamp their race without exception as infamous monsters in
wickedness.</p>
<p>The following is a remarkable instance of the love of costly
attire in a female Gipsy of the old school.&nbsp; The woman
alluded to obtained a very large sum of money from three maiden
ladies, pledging that it should be doubled by her art in
conjuration.&nbsp; She then decamped to another district, where
she bought a blood-horse, a black beaver hat, a new side-saddle
and bridle, a silver-mounted whip, and figured away in her
ill-obtained finery at the fairs.&nbsp; It is not easy to imagine
the disappointment and resentment of the covetous and credulous
ladies, whom she had so easily duped.&nbsp; With the present race
of our gutter-scum Gipsies the last remnant of Gipsy pride is
nearly dead&mdash;poverty, rags, and despair taking the
place.</p>
<p>Gipsies of the old type are not strangers to
pawnbrokers&rsquo; shops; but they do not visit these places for
the same <!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>purposes as the vitiated poor of our
trading towns.&nbsp; A pawnshop is their bank.&nbsp; When they
acquire property illegally, as by stealing, swindling, or
fortune-telling, they purchase valuable plate, and sometimes in
the same hour pledge it for safety.&nbsp; Such property they have
in store against days of adversity and trouble, which on account
of their dishonest habits often overtake them.&nbsp; Should one
of their families stand before a judge of his country, charged
with a crime which is likely to cost him his life, or to
transport him, every article of value is sacrificed to save him
from death or apprehended banishment.&nbsp; In such cases they
generally retain a counsel to plead for the brother in
adversity.&nbsp; Their attachment to the horse, donkey, rings,
snuff-box, silver spoons, and all things, except the clothes, of
the deceased relatives is very strong.&nbsp; With such articles
they will never part, except in the greatest distress, and then
they only pledge some of them, which are redeemed as soon as they
possess the means.</p>
<p>It has been stated by some writers, that there is hardly a
Gipsy in existence who could not, if desired, produce his ten or
twenty pounds &ldquo;at a pinch.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of those who
work, no doubt, could; but it is entirely erroneous, as many
other statements relating to the Gipsies, to imagine that the
whole of them are as well off as all this.&nbsp; Smith tells us
that there is not one in twenty who can show one pound, much less
twenty.&nbsp; A Gipsy named Boswell travelled about in the
Midland counties with a large van pretty well stocked with his
wares, and everybody, especially the Gipsies, thought he was a
rich man; but in course of time it came to pass that he died,
which event revealed the fact that he was not worth
half-a-crown.&nbsp; No class of men and women under the sun has
been more wicked than the Gipsies, and no class has prospered
less.&nbsp; By their evil deeds for centuries they have brought
themselves under the curse of God and the lash of the law
wherever they have been.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>&ldquo;To our foes we leave a shame!
disgrace can never die;<br />
Their sons shall blush to hear a name still blackened with a
lie.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their miserable condition, the persecution, misrepresentation,
and the treatment they are receiving are due entirely to their
own evil-doing&mdash;lying, cheating, robbing, and murder bring
their own reward.&nbsp; The Gipsies of to-day are drinking the
dregs of the cups they had mixed for others.&nbsp; The sly wink
of the eye intended to touch the heart of the innocent and simple
has proved to be the electric spark that has reached heaven, and
brought down the vengeance of Jehovah upon their heads.&nbsp; The
lies proceeding from their bad hearts have turned out to be a
swarm of wasps settling down upon their own pates; their stolen
goods have been smitten with God&rsquo;s wrath; the horses,
mules, and donkeys in their unlawful possession are steeds upon
which the Gipsies are riding to hell; and the fortune-telling
cards are burning the fingers of the Gipsy women; in one word,
the curse of God is following them in every footstep on account
of their present sins, and not on account of their past
traditions.&nbsp; Immediately they alter their course of life,
and &ldquo;cease to do evil and learn to do well&rdquo;&mdash;no
matter whether they are Jews or barbarians, bond or
free&mdash;the blessing of God will follow, and they will begin
to thrive and prosper.</p>
<p>Smoking and eating tobacco adds another leaden weight to those
already round their neck, and it helps to bow them down to the
ground&mdash;a short black pipe, the ranker and oftener it has
been used the more delicious will be the flavour, and the better
they will like it.&nbsp; When their &ldquo;baccy&rdquo; is
getting &ldquo;run out,&rdquo; the short pipe is handed round to
the company of Gipsies squatting upon the ground, without any
delicacy of feeling, for all of them to &ldquo;have a
pull.&rdquo;&nbsp; Spittoons are things they never use.&nbsp;
White, scented, cambric pocket-handkerchiefs are not often
brought into request upon their &ldquo;lovely faces.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They prefer allowing the bottom of the dresses the honour of
appearing before his worship &ldquo;the nose.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nothing pleases the <!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>Gipsies better than to give them
some of the weed.&nbsp; I saw a poor, dying, old Gipsy woman the
other day.&nbsp; Nothing seemed to please her so much, although
she could scarcely speak, as to delight in referring to the sins
of her youth, of a kind before referred to, and no present was so
acceptable to her as &ldquo;a nounce of baccy.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
said she &ldquo;would rather have it than gold,&rdquo; and I
&ldquo;could not have pleased her better.&rdquo;&nbsp; I doubt
whether she lived to smoke it.&nbsp; I think I am speaking within
the mark when I state that fully three-fourths of the Gipsy women
in this country are inveterate smokers.&nbsp; It is a black,
burning shame for us to have such a state of things in our
midst.&nbsp; In nine cases out of ten the children of drunken,
smoking women will turn out to be worthless scamps and vagabonds,
and a glance at the Gipsies will prove my statements.</p>
<p>Eternity will reveal their deeds of darkness&mdash;murders,
immorality, torturous and heart-rending treatment to their poor
slaves of women, beastly and murderous brutality to their poor
children.&nbsp; There is a terrible reckoning coming for the
&ldquo;Gipsy man,&rdquo; who can chuckle to his fowls, and kick,
with his iron-soled boot, his poor child to death; who can warm
and shelter his blackbird, and send the offspring of his own body
to sleep upon rotten straw and the dung-heap, covered over with
sticks and rags, through which light, hail, wind, rain, sleet,
and snow can find its way without let or hinderance; who can take
upon his knees a dog and fondle it in his bosom, and, at the same
time, spit in his wife&rsquo;s face with oaths and cursing, and
send her out in the snow on a piercing-cold winter&rsquo;s day,
half clad and worse fed, with child on her back and basket on her
arm, to practise the art of double-dyed lying and deception on
honest, simple people, in order to bring back her ill-gotten
gains to her semi-clad hovel, on which to fatten her &ldquo;lord
and master,&rdquo; by half-cleaned knuckle-bones, ham-shanks, and
pieces of bacon that fall from the &ldquo;rich man&rsquo;s
table.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>The following is a specimen of house-dwelling Gipsies
in the Midlands I have visited.&nbsp; In the room downstairs
there were a broken-down old squab, two rickety old chairs, and a
three-legged table that had to be propped against the wall, and a
rusty old poker, with a smoking fire-place.&nbsp; The Gipsy
father was a strong man, not over fond of work; he had been in
prison once; the mother, a strong Gipsy woman of the old type,
marked with small-pox, and plenty of tongue&mdash;by the way, I
may say I have not yet seen a dumb and deaf Gipsy.&nbsp; She
turned up her dress sleeves and showed me how she had &ldquo;made
the blood run out of another Gipsy woman for hitting her
child.&rdquo;&nbsp; As she came near to me exhibiting her
fisticuffing powers, I might have been a little nervous years
ago; but dealing with men and things in a rough kind of fashion
for so many years has taken some amount of nervousness of this
kind out of me.</p>
<p>It may be as well to remark here that the Gipsy women can do
their share of fighting, and are as equally pleased to have a
stand-up fight as the Gipsy men are.&nbsp; One of these Gipsy
women lives with a man who is not a thorough Gipsy, who spends a
deal of his time under lock and key on account of his poaching
inclinations; and other members of this large family are on the
same kind of sliding scale, and not one of whom can read or
write.</p>
<p>It is not pleasant to say strong things about clergymen, for
whom I have the highest respect; nevertheless, there are times
when respect for Christ&rsquo;s church, duty to country, love for
the children and anxiety for their eternal welfare, compels you
to step out of the beaten rut to expose, though with pain,
wrong-doing.&nbsp; In a day and Sunday school-yard connected with
the Church of England, not one hundred miles from London, there
are to be seen&mdash;and I am informed by them, except during the
hop-picking season, that it is their camping-ground, and has been
for years&mdash;one van, in which there are man, wife, young
woman, and a daughter of about fourteen years of age; the young
woman <!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>and daughter sleep in a kind of box
under the man and his wife.&nbsp; In another part of the yard is
a Gipsy tent, where God&rsquo;s broad earth answers the purpose
of a table, and a &ldquo;batten of straw&rdquo; serves as a
bed.&nbsp; There is a woman, two daughters, one of whom is of
marriageable age and the other far in her teens, and a youth I
should think about sixteen years of age.&nbsp; I should judge
that the mother and her two daughters sleep on one bed at one end
of the tent and the youth at the other; there is no partition
between them, and only about seven feet of space between each bed
of litter.&nbsp; In another tent there is man, wife, and one
child.&nbsp; When I was there, on the Sunday afternoon, they were
expecting the Gipsy &ldquo;to come home to his tent drunk and
wake the baby.&rdquo;&nbsp; In another tent there was a Gipsy
with his lawful wife and three children.&nbsp; One of the Gipsy
women in the yard frequently came home drunk, and I have seen her
smoking with a black pipe in her mouth three parts tipsy.&nbsp;
Now, I ask my countrymen if this is the way to either improve the
habits and morals of the Gipsies themselves, or to set a good
example to day and Sunday scholars.&nbsp; Drunkenness is one of
the evil associations of Gipsy life.&nbsp; Brandy and
&ldquo;fourpenny,&rdquo; or &ldquo;hell fire,&rdquo; as it is
sometimes called, are their chief drinks.&nbsp; A Gipsy of the
name of Lee boasted to me only a day or two since that he had
been drunk every night for more than a fortnight, his language
being, &ldquo;Oh! it is delightful to get drunk, tumble into a
row, and smash their peepers.&nbsp; What care we for the
bobbies.&rdquo;&nbsp; They seldom if ever use tumblers.&nbsp; A
large jug is filled with this stuff, in colour and thickness
almost like treacle and water, leaving a kind of salty taste
behind it as it passes out of sight; but, I am sorry to say, not
out of the body, mind, or brain, leaving a trail upon which is
written&mdash;more! more! more!&nbsp; Under its influence they
either turn saints or demons as will best serve their
purpose.&nbsp; The more drink some of the Gipsy women get the
more the red coloured piety is observable in their faces, and
when I have been <!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>talking to them, or otherwise, they
have said, &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bless the Lord,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, it is nice to be &rsquo;ligious and Christany,&rdquo;
as they have closed round me; and with the same breath they have
begun to talk of murder, bloodshed, and revenge, and to say,
&ldquo;How nice it is to get a living by telling
lies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Half an ounce of tobacco and a few gentle
words have a most wonderful effect upon their spirits and nerves
under such circumstances.&nbsp; I have frequently seen drunken
Gipsy women in the streets of London.&nbsp; Early this year I met
one of my old Gipsy women friends in Garrett Lane, Wandsworth,
with evidently more than she could carry, and a weakness was
observable in her knees; and when she saw me she was not so far
gone as not to know who I was.&nbsp; She tried to make a curtsy,
and in doing so very nearly lost her balance, and it took her
some ten yards to recover her perpendicular.&nbsp; With a little
struggling, stuttering, and stumbling, she got right, and pursued
her way to the tent.</p>
<p>In December of last year four Gipsies, of Acton Green, were
charged before the magistrates at Hammersmith with violently
assaulting an innkeeper for refusing to allow them to go into a
private part of his house.&nbsp; A terrible struggle ensued, and
a long knife was fetched out of their tents, and had they not
been stopped the consequences might have been fearful.&nbsp; They
were sent to gaol for two months, which would give them time for
reflection.&nbsp; A few days ago two Gipsies from the East End of
London were sent to gaol for thieving, and are now having their
turn upon the wheel of fortune.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whirl fiery circles, and the moon is
full:<br />
Imps with long tongues are licking at my brow,<br />
And snakes with eyes of flame crawl up my breast;<br />
Huge monsters glare upon me, some with horns,<br />
And some with hoofs that blaze like pitchy brands;<br />
Great trunks have some, and some are hung with beads.<br />
Here serpents dash their stings into my face,<br />
All tipped with fire; and there a wild bird drives<br />
<!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>His red-hot talons in my burning scalp.<br />
Here bees and beetles buzz about my ears<br />
Like crackling coals, and frogs strut up and down<br />
Like hissing cinders; wasps and waterflies<br />
Scorch deep like melting minerals.&nbsp; Murther!&nbsp;
Fire!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cries the Gipsy, as he rolls about on his bed of filthy
litter, in a tent whose only furniture is an old tin bucket
pierced with holes, a soap-box, and a few rags, with a
poor-looking, miserable woman for a wife, and a lot of wretched
half-starved, half-naked children crying round him for
bread.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give us bread!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Give us
bread!&rdquo; is their piteous cry.</p>
<p>The Gipsy in Hungary is a being who has puzzled the wits of
the inhabitants for centuries, and the habits of the Hungarian
Gipsies are abominable; their hovels, for they do not all live in
tents and encampments, are sinks of the vilest poverty and filth;
their dress is nothing but rags, and they live on carrion; and it
is in this pitiable condition they go singing and dancing to
hell.&nbsp; Nothing gives them more pleasure than to be told
where a dead pig, horse, or cow may be found, and the Gipsies,
young and old, will scamper to fetch it; decomposition rather
sharpens their ravenous appetites; at any rate, they will not
&ldquo;turn their noses up&rdquo; at it in disgust; in fact,
Grellmann goes so far as to say that human flesh is a dainty
morsel, especially that of children.&nbsp; What applies to the
Hungarian Gipsies will to a large extent apply to the Gipsies in
Spain, Germany, France, Russia, and our own country.&nbsp; There
is no proof of our Gipsies eating children; but if I am to
believe their own statements, the dead dogs, cats, and pigs that
happen to be in their way run the risk of being potted for soup,
and causing a &ldquo;smacking of the lips&rdquo; as the heathens
sit round their kettle&mdash;which answers the purpose of a
swill-tub when not needed for cooking&mdash;as it hangs over the
coke fire, into which they dip their platters with relish and
delight.&nbsp; What becomes of the dead donkeys, mules, ponies,
and horses that die during their trafficking is best known to
<!-- page 260--><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>themselves.&nbsp; No longer since than last winter I
was told by some Gipsies on the outskirts of London that some of
their fraternity had been seen on more than one occasion picking
up dead cats out of the streets of London to take home to their
dark-eyed beauties and lovely damsels.&nbsp; Only a few days
since I was told by a lot of Gipsies upon Cherry Island, and in
presence of some of the Lees, that some of their fraternity, and
they mentioned some of their names, had often picked up snails,
worms, &amp;c., and put them alive into a pan over their coke
fires, and as the life was being frizzled out of the creeping
things they picked them out of the pan with their fingers and put
them into their months without any further ceremony.&nbsp; I
cannot for the life of me think that human nature is at such a
low ebb among them as to make this kind of life general.&nbsp; At
most I should think cases of this kind are exceptional.&nbsp;
Their food, whether it be animal or vegetable, is generally
turned into a kind of dirty-looking, thick liquid, which they
think good enough to be called soup.&nbsp; Their principal meal
is about five o&rsquo;clock, upon the return of the mother after
her hawking and cadging expeditions.&nbsp; Their bread, as a
rule, is either bought, stolen, or begged.&nbsp; When they bake,
which is very seldom, they put their lumps of dough among the red
embers of their coke fires.&nbsp; Sometimes they will eat like
pigs, till they have to loose their garments for more room, and
other times they starve themselves to fiddle-strings.&nbsp; A few
weeks since, when snow was on the ground, I saw in the outskirts
of London eight half-starved, poor, little, dirty, Gipsy children
dining off three potatoes, and drinking the potato water as a
relish.&nbsp; They do not always use knife and fork.&nbsp; Table,
plates, and dishes are not universal among them.&nbsp; Their
whole kitchen and table requirements are an earthen pot, an iron
pan, which serves as a dish, a knife, and a spoon.&nbsp; When the
meal is ready the whole family sit round the pot or pan, and then
&ldquo;fall to it&rdquo; with their fingers and teeth,
Adam&rsquo;s knives and forks, and the ground providing the <!--
page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>table and plates.&nbsp; Boiled pork is, as a rule,
their universal, every-day, central pot-boiler, and the longer it
is boiled the harder it gets, like the Irishman who boiled his
egg for an hour to get it soft, and then had to give it up as a
bad job.&nbsp; Some of these kind-hearted folks have, on more
than one occasion, given me &ldquo;a feed&rdquo; of it.&nbsp; It
is sweet and nice, but awfully satisfying, and I think two meals
would last me for a week very comfortably; all I should require
would be to get a good dinner off their knuckle-bones, roll
myself up like a hedgehog, doze off like Hubert Petalengro into a
semi-unconscious state, and I should be all right for three or
four days.&nbsp; &ldquo;Beggars must not be
choosers.&rdquo;&nbsp; They have done what they could to make me
comfortable, and for which I have been very thankful.&nbsp; I
have had many a cup of tea with them, and hope to do so
again.</p>
<p>One writer observes:&mdash;&ldquo;Commend me to Gipsy life and
hard living.&nbsp; Robust exercise, out-door life, and pleasant
companions are sure to beget good dispositions both of body and
mind, and would create a stomach under the very ribs of death
capable of digesting a bar of pig-iron.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their habits
of uncleanliness are most disgusting.&nbsp; Occasionally you will
meet with clean people, and children with clean, red, chubby
faces; but in nine cases out of ten they are of parents who have
had a different bringing up than squatting about in the mud and
filth.&nbsp; One woman I know at Notting Hill, and who was born
in an Oxfordshire village, is at the present time surrounded with
filth of the most sickening kind, which she cannot help, and to
her credit manages to keep her children tolerably clean and nice
for a woman of her position.&nbsp; There is another at Garrett
Lane, Wandsworth; another at Sheepcot Lane, Battersea; two at
Upton Park; one at Cherry Island; two at Hackney Wick, and
several others in various parts on the outskirts of London.&nbsp;
At Hackney Wick I saw twenty tents and vans, connected with which
there were forty men and women and about seventy children of all
ages, entirely devoid of all <!-- page 262--><a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>sanitary
arrangements.&nbsp; A gentleman who was building some property in
the neighbourhood told me that he had seen grown-up youths and
big girls running about entirely nude in the morning, and
squatting about the ground and leaving their filth behind them
more like animals than human beings endowed with souls and
reason.&nbsp; When I was there it was with some difficulty I
could put my foot in a clean place.&nbsp; The same kind of thing
occurs in a more or less degree wherever Gipsies are located,
and, sad to relate, house-dwelling Gipsies are very little better
in this respect.&nbsp; Grellmann, speaking of the German and
Hungarian Gipsies many years ago, says:&mdash;&ldquo;We may
easily account for the colour of their skin.&nbsp; The
Laplanders, Samoyeds, as well as the Siberians, have bronze,
yellow-coloured skins, in consequence of living from their
childhood in smoke and dirt, as the Gipsies do.&nbsp; These would
long ago have got rid of their swarthy complexions if they had
discontinued this Gipsy manner of living.&nbsp; Observe only a
Gipsy from his birth till he comes to man&rsquo;s estate, and one
must be convinced that their colour is not so much owing to their
descent as to the nastiness of their bodies.&nbsp; In summer the
child is exposed to the scorching sun, in winter it is shut up in
a smoky hut.&nbsp; Some mothers smear their children over with
black ointment, and leave them to fry in the sun or near the
fire.&nbsp; They seldom trouble themselves about washing or other
modes of cleaning themselves.&nbsp; Experience also shows us that
it is more their manner of life than descent which has propagated
this black colour of the Gipsies from generation to
generation.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am told, and I verily believe it, that
many of the children are not washed for years together.&nbsp; I
have seen over and over again dirt peeling off the poor
children&rsquo;s bodies and faces like a skin, and leaving a kind
of white patch behind it, presenting a kind of a piebald
spectacle.&nbsp; Some of the children never take their clothes
off till they drop off in shreds.&nbsp; Many of the Gipsies, both
old and young, have only one suit of <!-- page 263--><a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>clothes.&nbsp; English delicacy of feeling and
sentiment for female virtue must stand abashed with horror at
this kind of civilisation in the nineteenth century of Christian
England.&nbsp; I have seen washing done on the Sunday afternoon
among them, and while the clothes have been drying on the line
the women and children have been roasting themselves before the
fires in nearly a nude state.&nbsp; A Sunday or two ago a poor
Gipsy woman was washing her only smoky-looking blanket late in
the afternoon, and upon which she would have to lay that
night.&nbsp; It was a cold, wintry, drizzling afternoon, and how
it was to get dry was a puzzle to me.&nbsp; A Gipsy woman, named
Hearn, said to me a few days ago, in answer to some conversation
relating to their dirty habits; &ldquo;The reason for the Gipsies
not washing themselves oftener was on account of their catching
cold after each time they washed.&rdquo;&nbsp; She &ldquo;only
washed herself once in a fortnight, and she was almost sure to
catch cold after it.&rdquo;&nbsp; In some things the real old
Gipsies are very particular, <i>i.e.</i>, they will on no account
take their food out of cups, saucers, or basins, that have been
washed in the same pansions in which their linen has been washed;
so sensitive are they on this point that if they found out that
by an accident this custom had been transgressed they would
immediately break the vessel to pieces.&nbsp; This is a custom
picked up by the Gipsies among the Jews in their wandering from
India through the Holy Land.&nbsp; Another practice they adopt in
common with the Jews is, swearing or taking oaths over their dead
relations.&nbsp; The customs, practices, and words picked up by
them during their wanderings have added to their
mystification.&nbsp; While they will respect certain delicacy
observed among the Jews, they will eat pork, the most detestable
of all food in the eyes of the Israelites, and will even pay a
greater price for it than for beef or mutton.&nbsp; An
Englishwoman, who had married a Gipsy named Smith, told me very
recently, in presence of her mother-in-law and another woman,
that she had seen her husband eat a small <!-- page 264--><a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>plate of
cooked snails as a dainty.&nbsp; While the daughter-in-law was
telling me this, the old Gipsy mother-in-law, with one foot in
the grave, not far from Mary&rsquo;s Place, near the Potteries,
Notting Hill, was trying to make me believe what a choice dish
there was in store for me if I would allow her to cook me a
hedgehog.&nbsp; She said I should &ldquo;find it nicer than the
finest rabbit or pheasant I had ever tasted.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
fine, old, Gipsy woman, as regards her appearance, although
suffering from congestion of lungs and inflammation, and
expecting every moment to be her last, would joke and make fun as
if nothing was the matter with her.&nbsp; When I questioned her
upon the sin of lying, she said, &ldquo;If the dear Lord spares
me, I shall tell lies again.&nbsp; I could not get on without it;
how could I?&nbsp; I could not sell my things without
lies.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was rather severe, and this was a pleasing
feature in the old woman&rsquo;s character, upon a Gipsy who was
pretending to &ldquo;&rsquo;ligious,&rdquo; and yet living upon
the money gained by his wife in telling fortunes.&nbsp; She said,
&ldquo;If I must be &lsquo;&rsquo;ligious,&rsquo; I would be
&lsquo;&rsquo;ligious.&rsquo;&nbsp; You might,&rdquo; said the
old woman, &ldquo;as well eat the devil as suck his broth.&nbsp;
Ah! I hate the fellow.&rdquo;&nbsp; After asking her, and getting
her interpretation of &ldquo;God bless you&rdquo; in Romany,
which is Mi-Doovel-Parik-tooti&mdash;and she was the only Gipsy
round London who could put the words in Romany&mdash;and some
other conversation accompanied with &ldquo;coppers and
baccy,&rdquo; &amp;c., and to which she replied,
&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; with as much earnestness as if she was the
greatest saint outside heaven, we parted.</p>
<p>Much has been said and written years ago about the chastity,
fidelity, and faithfulness of the Gipsies towards each
other.&nbsp; This may have been the case, and in a few
exceptional cases it holds good now; but if I am to believe these
men themselves they are very isolated indeed, and what I have
said upon this point about the brick-yard <i>employ&eacute;s</i>
in my &ldquo;Cry of the Children from the Brick-yards of
England,&rdquo; and also those living in canal-boats, in
&ldquo;Our <!-- page 265--><a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>Canal Population,&rdquo; holds good,
but with ten times more force concerning the Gipsies.&nbsp;
Immorality abounds to a most alarming degree.&nbsp; Incest,
wantonness, lasciviousness, lechery, whoring, bigamy, and every
other abomination low, degrading, carnal appetites, propensity,
and lust originate and encourage they practise openly, without
the least blush; in fact, I question if many of them know what it
is to blush at all.</p>
<p>I have heard a deal of disgusting, filthy language in my time
among brick-yard and canal-boat women, but not a tithe so
sickening as among some Gipsy women.&nbsp; I pitied them, and to
look upon them as charitably as possible I set it down to their
extreme ignorance of the language they used.&nbsp; A Gipsy at
Upton Park last week named D--- gloried to my face in the fact
that he was not married.&nbsp; This same man has a brother not
far from Mitcham Common living with two sisters in an unlawful
state.&nbsp; Abraham Smith, a Gipsy at Upton Park, who is over
seventy, and tells me that he is trying to serve God and get to
heaven, mentioned a case to me of a Gipsy and a woman at Hackney
Wick.&nbsp; The man has several children by a woman now living
with another man, and the woman has several children by another
man.</p>
<p>This Gipsy, S---, and his woman S---, turned both lots of
their former own children adrift upon the wide, wide world,
uncared for, unprotected, and abandoned, while they are living
and indulging in sin to their hearts&rsquo; content, without the
least shame and remorse.&nbsp; Inquire of whoever I may, and look
whichever way Providence directs me among the various phases of
Gipsy life, I find the same black array of facts staring me in
the face, the same dolorous issues everywhere.&nbsp; The words
reason, honour, restraint, and fidelity are words not to be found
in their vocabulary.&nbsp; My later inquiries fully confirm my
previous statements as to two-thirds living as husband and wife
being unmarried.&nbsp; I have not found a Gipsy to contradict
this statement.&nbsp; Abraham Smith fully agrees with it.</p>
<p><!-- page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>The marriage ceremony of the Gipsies is a very off-hand
affair.&nbsp; Formerly there used to be some kind of ceremony
performed by a friend.&nbsp; Now the ceremony is not performed by
any one.&nbsp; Of course there are a few who get married at the
church, which, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, is
performed by the clergyman gratuitously.&nbsp; As soon as a boy
has arrived in his teens he begins to think that something more
than eating and drinking is necessary to him, and as the children
of Gipsies are under no kind of parental, moral, or social
restraint, a connection is easily formed with girls of twelve,
some of them of close relationship.&nbsp; After a few hours, in
many cases, of courtship, they go together, and the affair so far
is over.&nbsp; They leave their parents&rsquo; tents and set up
one for themselves, and for a short time this kind of life
lasts.&nbsp; In course of time children are born, the only
attendant being, in many instances, another Gipsy woman, or it
may be members of their own families see to the poor woman in her
hour of need.&nbsp; If they have no vessel in which to wash the
newly-born child, they dig a hole in the ground, which is filled
with cold water, and the Gipsy babe is washed in it.&nbsp; This
being over, the poor little thing is wrapped in some old
rags.&nbsp; This was the custom years ago, and I verily believe
the Gipsies have gone backwards instead of forwards in matters of
this kind.</p>
<p>The following brief account of a visit&mdash;one of many I
have made to Gipsy encampments at Hackney Marshes and other
places during the present winter&mdash;will give some faint idea
of what Gipsy life is in this country, as seen by me during my
interviews with the Gipsies.&nbsp; The morning was dark; the snow
was falling fast; about six inches of snow and slush were upon
the ground&mdash;my object being in this case, as in others,
viz., to visit them at inclement seasons of the weather to find
as many of the Gipsies in their tents as possible, and as I
closed my door I said, &ldquo;Lord, direct me,&rdquo; and off I
started, not knowing which way to go.&nbsp; Ultimately I found my
way to Holborn, and took the &rsquo;bus, and, <!-- page 267--><a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>as I
thought, to Hackney, which turned out to be &ldquo;a delusion and
a snare,&rdquo; for at the terminus I found myself some two and a
half miles from the Marshes; however, I was not going to turn
back if the day was against me, and after laying in a stock of
sweets for the Gipsy children, and &ldquo;baccy&rdquo; for the
old folks, I commenced my squashy tramp till I arrived at the
Marshes; the difficulty here was the road leading to the tents
being covered ankle deep with snow and water, but as my feet were
pretty well wet I could be no worse off if I paddled through
it.&nbsp; Consequently, after these little difficulties were
overcome, I found myself in the midst of about a score of tents
and vans of all sizes and descriptions, connected with which
there were not less than thirty-five grown-up Gipsies and about
sixty poor little Gipsies.&nbsp; The first van I came to was a
kind of one-horse cart with a cover over it; inside was a strong,
hulking-looking fellow and a poor, sickly-looking woman with five
children.&nbsp; The woman had only been confined a few days, and
looked more fit for &ldquo;the box&rdquo; than to be washing on
such a cold, wintry day.&nbsp; On a bed&mdash;at least, some
rags&mdash;were three poor little children, one of whom was sick,
which the mother tried to prevent by putting her dirty apron to
the child&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; The large, piercing eyes of this
poor, death-looking Gipsy child I shall never forget; they have
looked into my innermost soul scores of times since then, and
every time I think about this sight of misery the sickly
child&rsquo;s eyes seem to cry out, &ldquo;Help me!&nbsp; Help
me!&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor woman said it was the marshes that
caused the illness, but my firm opinion is that it was neither
more nor less than starvation.&nbsp; The poor woman seemed to be
given up to despair.&nbsp; A few questions put to her in the
momentary absence of the man elicited the fact that she was no
Gipsy.&nbsp; She had been brought up as a Sunday-school scholar
and teacher, and had been beguiled away from her home by this
&ldquo;Gipsy man.&rdquo;&nbsp; She said she could tell me a lot
if I would come some other time.&nbsp; She also said,
&ldquo;Gipsy life as it is at present carried out ought <!-- page
268--><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>to
be put a stop to, and would be if people knew all.&rdquo;&nbsp;
With a few coppers given to her and the children we parted.&nbsp;
In another tent on the marshes there was a man, woman, and six
children.&nbsp; The tent was about twelve feet long, six feet six
inches wide, and an average height of about three feet, making a
total of about two hundred and thirty-four cubic feet of space
for man, wife, and six children.&nbsp; These were of both sexes,
grown-up and in their teens.&nbsp; Their bed was straw upon the
damp ground, and their sheets, rags.&nbsp; The man was
half-drunk, and the poor children were running about half-naked
and half-starved.&nbsp; The woman had some Gipsy blood in her
veins, but the man was an Englishman, and had, so he said, been a
soldier.&nbsp; With a few coppers and sweets among the children,
and in the midst of &ldquo;Good-byes!&rdquo; and &ldquo;God bless
you&rsquo;s!&rdquo; I left them, promising to pay them another
visit.&nbsp; Out of these twenty families only three were
properly married, and only two could read and write, and these
were the poor woman who had been a Sunday-school scholar and the
man who had been a soldier, and, strange to say, the children of
these two people could not read a sentence or tell a
letter.&nbsp; No minister ever visited them, and not one ever
attended a place of worship.&nbsp; In a visit to an encampment in
another part of London I came across a poor Irishwoman, who had
been allured away from her respectable home at the age of sixteen
by one of the Gipsy gang.&nbsp; When I saw her she was sitting
crying, with two half-starved children by her side, who, owing to
the coke fire, had bad eyes.&nbsp; Their home was an old ragged
tent, and their bed, rotten straw.&nbsp; When I saw them, and it
was about one o&rsquo;clock, they had not tasted food for
twenty-four hours.&nbsp; I sent for a loaf for them, and they set
to work upon it with as much relish as if they had been gnawing
at the leg of a Christmas fat turkey.&nbsp; The poor Gipsy woman
had been a Sunday-school scholar, and could read and write, but
neither her husband nor children could tell a letter.&nbsp; Her
taking to Gipsy life had broken her father&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp;
Her eldest child, <!-- page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>a fine little girl of about seven
years of age, had been taken from her by her friends, and was
being educated and cared for.&nbsp; A few weeks since the little
daughter was anxious to see her mother, consequently she was
taken to her tent; but, sad to relate, instead of the daughter
going to kiss her mother, as she would expect, she turned away
from her with a shudder and a shriek, and for the whole day the
child did nothing but cry.&nbsp; It would not touch a morsel of
anything.&nbsp; The only pleasant look that came upon its
countenance was as it was leaving.&nbsp; As the poor child was
leaving the tent she would not kiss her mother or say the usual
&ldquo;Good-bye&rdquo; as she went away.&nbsp; This poor woman,
as in the case of the woman at Hackney, said she could tell me a
lot of things, which she would some time, and said, &ldquo;Gipsy
life ought to be put a stop to, for there was something about it
more than people knew,&rdquo; and I thoroughly believe what this
poor woman says.&nbsp; It is my firm conviction that there is
much more in connection with Gipsy life than many people imagine,
or is dreamt of in their philosophy.&nbsp; There is a substratum
of iniquity lower than any writers have ever touched.&nbsp; There
are certain things in connection with their dark lives, hidden
and veiled by their slang language, that may not come out in my
day, but most surely daylight will be shed upon them some
day.&nbsp; They will kill and murder each other, fight and
quarrel like hyenas, but certain things they will not divulge,
and so long as the well-being of society is not in danger I
suppose we have no right to interfere.&nbsp; A query arises
here.&nbsp; Their past actions back me up in this theory.&nbsp;
Upon Mitcham Common last week there were nearly two hundred tents
and vans.&nbsp; In one tent, which may be considered a specimen
of many others, there were two men and their wives, and about
twelve children of both sexes and of all ages.&nbsp; In another
tent there were nine children of both sexes and all ages, some of
them men and women, and for the life of me I cannot tell how they
are all packed when they sleep&mdash;I suppose like herrings in a
box, pell-mell, &ldquo;all <!-- page 270--><a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>of a
heap.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of these Gipsy young women was a model,
and has her time pretty much occupied during the day.&nbsp; I
have been among house-dwelling Gipsies in the Midland counties,
and have found twelve to fifteen men, women, and children,
squatting about on the floor, which they used as a workshop,
sitting-room, drawing-room, and bed-room; although there was a
bed-room up-stairs it was not often used&mdash;so I was told by
the landlady.</p>
<p>There is much more sickness among the Gipsies than is
generally known, especially among the children.&nbsp; They have
strong faith in herbs; the principal being chicken-weed,
groundsel, elder leaves, rue, wild sage, love-wort, agrimony,
buckbean, wood-betony, and others; these they boil in a saucepan
like they would cabbages, and then drink the decoction.&nbsp;
They only go to the chemist or surgeon at the last
extremity.&nbsp; They are very much like the man who tried by
degrees to train his donkey to live and work without food, and
just as he succeeded the poor Balaam died; and so it is with the
poor Gipsy children.&nbsp; It kills them to break them in to the
hardships of Gipsy life.&nbsp; Occasionally I have heard of
Gipsies who act as human beings should do with their
children.&nbsp; A well-to-do Gipsy whom I know&mdash;one of the
Lees, a son of Mrs. Simpson&mdash;has spent over &pound;30 in
doctors&rsquo; bills this winter for his children&rsquo;s
good.&nbsp; Not one Gipsy in a thousand would do likewise.</p>
<p>Gipsies die like other folk, although before doing so they may
have lived and quarrelled like the Kilkenny cats among other
Gipsies; but at death these things are all forgotten, and a Gipsy
funeral seems to be the means to revive all the good they knew
about the person dead and a burying of all the bad connected with
the dead Gipsy&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; I am now referring to a few of
the better class of Gipsies.&nbsp; Gipsies, as a rule, pay
special regard to the wishes of a dying Gipsy, and will sacrifice
almost anything to carry them out.&nbsp; I attended the funeral
of a house-dwelling Gipsy, Mrs. Roberts, at Notting Hill, a few
weeks ago.&nbsp; The editor and proprietor of the <i>Suburban
Press</i>, <!-- page 271--><a name="page271"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 271</span>refers to this funeral in his
edition under date February 28th, as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;On
Monday last a noteworthy event took place in the humble locality
of the Potteries, Notting Dale.&nbsp; In this district are
congregated a miscellaneous population of the poorest order, who
get what living they can out of the brick-fields or adjoining
streets and lanes, or by costermongering, tinkering, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.&nbsp; They dwell together in the poorest and most
melancholy-looking cottages, some in sheds and outhouses, or in
dilapidated vans, for it is the resort and <i>locale</i> of many
of the Gipsies that wander in the western suburbs.&nbsp; Yet all
these make up a kind of community and live together as friends
and neighbours, and every now and again they show themselves
amenable to good influences, and characters of humble mark and
power arise among them.&nbsp; To those who sympathise with the
poet who sings of the</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Short and simple annals of the
poor,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we scarcely know a region that can be studied to greater
advantage.&nbsp; In the present instance it was the funeral of an
old inhabitant of the Gipsy tribe, one of the oldest, most
respected, and loved of all the nomads, and related in some way
to many Gipsy families in London and the neighbouring
counties.&nbsp; Abutting from the Walmer Road is a good sized
court or alley called &lsquo;Mary Place,&rsquo; and in a nook of
one of the small cottages here lived Mrs. Roberts for a number of
years, who has been described to us by one who long enjoyed her
acquaintance as &lsquo;a very superior woman, intelligent and
happy Christian.&rsquo;&nbsp; So that she must indeed have shone
in that humble and sombre spot as a &lsquo;gem of purest ray
serene,&rsquo; though not exactly as the flower</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;Born to blush
unseen,<br />
And waste its sweetness on the desert air.&rsquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>For the comprehensive genius of Christian sympathy and labour
had found her out, and she was known and respected, and her
influence was felt by all around her.&nbsp; She lived for <!--
page 272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>years a widow, but with five grown-up, strong, and
thrifty children&mdash;two sons and three daughters and troops of
friends&mdash;to cheer her latter days.&nbsp; The
preliminaries&mdash;a service of song conducted by Mr. Adams and
his sons&mdash;were soon over, and the coffin being lifted
through the window was placed on the strong shoulders which had
been appointed to convey it to Brompton Cemetery, a distance of
some three miles.&nbsp; It was a neat coffin, covered with black
cloth, and when the pall had been thrown over it affectionate
hands placed upon it two or three large handsome wreaths of
immortals white as snow, and so the procession moved off followed
by weeping sons, daughters, and friends, and a host of
sympathising neighbours, to the strains of the &lsquo;Dead March
in Saul.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>Requiescat in pace</i>.&nbsp; Among
those present at this interesting ceremony standing next to us,
and sharing in part our umbrella, was a gentleman whose name and
vocation we were not aware until afterwards.&nbsp; We were glad,
however, to learn that we were unwittingly conversing with no
other than Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, Leicester, the
philanthropic and well-known promoter of the
&lsquo;Brick-maker&rsquo;s&rsquo; and &lsquo;Canal
Boatman&rsquo;s&rsquo; Acts, who has specially devoted himself to
the improvement of the social condition of these too-neglected
people.&nbsp; He is now giving his attention to the case of the
Gipsies, and specially to the children, to whom he is anxious to
see extended among other things the provisions of the School
Board Act.&nbsp; The great and good work of Mr. Smith has already
attracted the attention of a number of charitable Christian
people, and it has not been overlooked by Her Majesty the Queen,
who, with her accustomed care and kindness, has expressed her
special interest therein.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was a good, Christian
woman, and I think I am speaking within bounds when I say that
there is not one in five hundred like she was.&nbsp; Before she
died she wished for two things to be carried out at her
funeral&mdash;one was that she should be carried on
Gipsies&rsquo; shoulders all the way to Brompton Cemetery, a
distance of some miles; and the <!-- page 273--><a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>other was
that Mr. Adams, a gentleman in the neighbourhood, should conduct
a service of song just before the funeral <i>cort&eacute;ge</i>
left the humble domicile; both requests were carried out,
notwithstanding that it was a pouring wet day.&nbsp; The service
of song was very impressive, surrounded as we were by some two
hundred Gipsies and others of the lowest of the low, living in
one of the darkest places in London.&nbsp; Some stood with their
mouths open and appeared as if they had not heard of the name of
Jesus before, and there were others whose features betokened
strong emotion, and upon whose cheeks could be seen the trickling
tears as we sung, among others:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Shall we gather at the river,<br />
Where bright angels&rsquo; feet have trod,<br />

<p>It has frequently been stated that the Gipsies never allow
their poor to go into the union workhouses; this statement is
both erroneous, false, and misleading.&nbsp; Clayton, a Gipsy, at
Ashby-de-la-Zouch, told me only the other day that he knew an old
Gipsy woman who was living in the Melton Mowbray Union Workhouse
at the present time, and mentioned some others who had died in
the union, a few connected with his own family.&nbsp; Abraham
Smith, a respectable and an old Christian Gipsy, mentioned the
names of a dozen or more Gipsies of his acquaintance who had died
in the <!-- page 274--><a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>union workhouse, some in the
Biggleswade Union, of the name of Shaw.&nbsp; There was a time
when there was a little repugnance to the union, but this feeling
has died out, thus adding another proof that the Gipsies, in many
respects, are not so good as what they were fifty years or more
ago; and this fact, to my mind, calls loudly for Government
interference as regards the education of the children.&nbsp;
Abraham Smith also further stated that nearly all the old people
belonging to one family of S--- had died in the workhouse in
Bedfordshire.&nbsp; Another thing has forced itself upon my
attention, viz., that there seems to be a number of poor
unfortunate idiots among them.&nbsp; I know, for a fact, of one
family where there are two poor creatures, one of whom is in the
asylum, and of another family where there is one, and a number in
various parts where they are semi-idiotic, and only next door to
the asylum.&nbsp; These painful facts will plainly show to all
Christian-thinking men and women, and to others who love their
country and seeks its welfare, that the time has arrived for the
Gipsies to be taken hold of in a plain, practical, common-sense
manner by those at the helm of affairs, and placed in such a
position as to help themselves to some of the blessings we are in
possession of ourselves.&nbsp; During all my inquiries, when the
Gipsies have not fallen in with all I have said with reference to
Gipsy life, they have all agreed without exception to the plan I
have sketched out for the education of their children and the
registration of their tents, &amp;c.</p>
<p>In the days of Hoyland and Borrow the Gipsies were very
anxious for the education of their children and struggled hard
themselves to bring it about.&nbsp; Sixty years ago one of the
Lovells sent three of his children to school, at No. 5, George
Street, taught by Partak Ivery, and paid sixpence per week each
with them; but the question of religion came up and the children
were sent home.&nbsp; The schoolmaster, Ivery, said that he had
had six Gipsy children sent to his school, and when placed among
the other children they <!-- page 275--><a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>were
reduceable to order.&nbsp; It is a standing disgrace and a shame
to us as a nation professing Christianity that at this time we
had in our midst ten to fifteen thousand poor little heathen
children thirsting for knowledge, and no one to hand it to them
or put them in the way to help themselves.&nbsp; The sin lays at
some one&rsquo;s door, and I would not like to be in their shoes
for something.&nbsp; While this dense ignorance was manifest
among the poor Gipsy children at our doors we were scattering the
Bibles all over the world, and sending missionaries by hundreds
to foreign lands and supporting them by hundreds of thousands of
pounds gladly subscribed by our hard-working artisans and
others.&nbsp; Not that I am finding fault with those who take an
interest in foreign missions in the least&mdash;would to God that
more were done for every nation upon the face of the
globe&mdash;but I do think in matters relating to the welfare of
the children we ought to look more at home.</p>
<p>With reference to missionary effort among the Gipsies, I must
confess that I am not a strong advocate for a strictly sectarian
missionary organisation to be formed with headquarters in London,
and a paid staff of officials, to convert the Gipsies.&nbsp; If
the act is passed upon the basis I have laid down, the result
will be that in course of time the Gipsies will be
localised.&nbsp; I am strongly in favour of all sections of
Christ&rsquo;s Church dealing with our floating population,
whether upon land or water, in their own localities, and in a
kind of spirit of holy rivalry among themselves, if I may use the
term.&nbsp; For the life of me I cannot see why temporary wooden
erections, something of the &ldquo;penny-gaff&rdquo; style,
should not be erected upon race-courses, and in the market-places
during fair time, in which religious services could be held free
from all sectarian bias, and which could be called the
Showman&rsquo;s or Gipsy&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp; There are times
when a short interesting service could be held without coming in
collision with the steam whistles of the
&ldquo;round-abouts,&rdquo; &ldquo;big drums,&rdquo; reports from
the &ldquo;rifle galleries,&rdquo; the screams and shouts of
stall-keepers; <!-- page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>and at any rate, I think it would be
better to have a number of organisations at work rather than one,
dealing both with our Gipsies and canal-boatmen.&nbsp; In
whatever form missionary effort is put forth, it must go further
than that of a clergyman, who told me one Sunday afternoon last
year, after he had been preaching in the most fashionable church
in Kensington, to the effect that, if any of the large number of
Gipsies who encamped in his parish in the country, and not far
from the vicarage, &ldquo;raised their hats to him as he passed
them, he returned the compliment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor stuff this to
educate their children and to civilise and Christianise their
parents.</p>
<p>It is my decided opinion that if the Gipsy children had been
taken hold of at that day, and placed side by side with the
children of other working classes, we should not by this time
have had a Gipsy wigwam flitting about our country; fifty
years&rsquo; educational influences mean, to a great extent,
their present and eternal salvation.&nbsp; A tremendous
responsibility and sin hangs, and will hang, about the necks of
those who have in the past, or will in the future, shut the door
of the school in the face of the poor Gipsy child, and turn it
into the streets to perish everlastingly.&nbsp; I am confident
the Gipsies will do their part if a simple plan for its
accomplishment can be set in motion.&nbsp; Harshness, cruelty,
and insult, rigid, and extreme measures will do no good with the
Gipsies.&nbsp; Fiery persecution will only frustrate my
object.&nbsp; God knows, they are bad enough, and I have no wish
to mince matters, or to paint them white, as fiction has
done.&nbsp; I have tried&mdash;how far I have succeeded it is not
for me to say&mdash;to expose the evils, and not individuals,
thoroughly, in accordance with my duty to my God, my country, and
my conscience, without partiality, bias, or fear, be the
consequences what they may.&nbsp; To write a book full of glowing
colour, pictures, fancies, imagination, and fiction, is both more
profitable and pleasant.&nbsp; The waft of a scented
pocket-handkerchief across one&rsquo;s face by the hand of a fair
<!-- page 277--><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>and lovely damsel is only as a fleeting shadow and a
passing vapour; they quickly come and they quickly go, leaving no
footstep behind them; a shooting star and a flitting comet, and
all is in darkness blacker than ever.&nbsp; Somehow or other the
Gipsies will, if possible, encamp near a school, but they lack
the power to enter, and some of them, no doubt, could send their
children to school for a few days occasionally; but the Gipsies
have got it in their heads that their children are not wanted,
and this is the case with the show people&rsquo;s children.&nbsp;
Last autumn I saw myself an encampment of Gipsies upon Turnham
Green; there were about thirty Gipsy children playing upon the
school-fence, not one of whom could either read or write.&nbsp;
The school was only half full, and the teacher was looking very
pleasantly out of the door of the school upon the poor, ignorant
children as they were rolling about in the mud.&nbsp; In another
part of London a Gipsy owns some cottages, with some spare land
between each cottage; upon this land there is her own van and a
number of other vans and tents, for which standing ground they
pay the Gipsy woman a rent of one shilling and sixpence per week
each.&nbsp; Neither herself nor any of the Gipsies connected with
the encampment could tell a letter, and there were some sixty to
seventy men, women, and children of all ages; and the strange
part of the thing is, the Gipsy woman&rsquo;s tenants in her
cottages were compelled by the School Board officer to send their
children to school, while the Gipsy children were running wild
like colts, and revelling in dirt and filth in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; A similar state of things to this exists in
a more or less degree with all the other encampments on the
outskirts of London.&nbsp; At one of the large encampments I
tried to find if there were really any who could read and write,
and to put this to the test I took the <i>Christian World</i> and
the <i>Christian Globe</i> with me.&nbsp; The Gipsy lad who they
said was &ldquo;a clever scholard&rdquo; was brought to me, and I
put the <i>Christian World</i> before him to see if he could read
the large <!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>letters; sad to say, instead of
<i>Christian World</i>, he called it &ldquo;Christmas,&rdquo; and
there he stuck and could get no further.&nbsp; I have said some
strong things, and endeavoured to lay bare some hard facts
relating to Gipsy life in the preceding part of this book, with a
view to enlist help and sympathy for the poor children, and not
to submit the Gipsy fathers to insult and ridicule.</p>

<p>From the mode of living among the Gipsies, the mother is often
necessitated to leave her tent in the morning, and seldom returns
to it before night.&nbsp; Their children are then left in or
about their solitary camps, having many times no adult with them;
the elder children then have the care of the younger ones.&nbsp;
Those who are old enough gather wood for fuel; nor is stealing it
thought a crime.&nbsp; By the culpable neglect of the parents in
this respect the children are often exposed to accidents by fire,
and melancholy instances of children being burnt and scalded to
death are not unfrequent.&nbsp; One poor woman relates that two
of her children have thus lost their lives by fire during her
absence from her tent at different periods, and some years ago a
child was scalded to death at Southampton.</p>
<p>The following account will faintly show something of the
hardships of Gipsy children&rsquo;s lives:&mdash;It was winter,
and the weather was unusually cold, there being much snow on the
ground.&nbsp; The tent, which was only covered with a ragged
blanket, was pitched on the lee side of a small hawthorn
bush.&nbsp; The children had stolen a few green sticks from the
hedges, but they would not burn.&nbsp; There was no straw in the
tent, and only one blanket to lay betwixt six children and the
frozen ground, with nothing to cover them.&nbsp; The youngest of
these children was three and the eldest seventeen years
old.&nbsp; In addition to this wretchedness the smaller children
were nearly naked.&nbsp; The youngest was squatted on the ground,
her little feet and legs bare, and gnawing a frozen turnip which
had been stolen from an adjoining field.&nbsp; None of them had
tasted bread for more than a day.&nbsp; The <!-- page 279--><a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>moment they
saw their visitor, the little ones repeatedly shouted,
&ldquo;Here is the gemman come for us!&rdquo;&nbsp; Some money
was given to the eldest sister to buy bread with, at which their
joy was greatly increased.&nbsp; Straw was also provided for them
to sleep on, four were measured for clothes, and after a few days
they were placed under proper care.&nbsp; The youngest child
died, however, a short time after in consequence of having been
so neglected in infancy.</p>
<p>During last June a Gipsy woman, of the name of Bishop, was
found in one of the tents, on a common just outside London, with
her throat cut and her child lying dead by her side in a pool of
blood, and the man with whom she cohabited&mdash;true to his
Gipsy character&mdash;refused to answer any questions concerning
this horrible affair.&nbsp; An impression has gone the round for
years that the Gipsies are exceedingly kind and affectionate to
their children, in some instances it, no doubt, is true, but they
are rare indeed if I may judge from appearances.&nbsp; I have yet
to learn that starvation, allowing their children to grow up
infinitely worse than barbarians, subjecting them to fearful
oaths and curses, and inflicting upon the poor children blows
with sticks, used with murderous passion, to within an inch of
their lives, exhibits much of the lamb-like spirit, dove-like
innocence, and childish simplicity fiction would picture to our
minds concerning these English barbarians as they camp on the
mossy banks on a hot summer day.&nbsp; In the presence of myself
and a friend one of these lawless fellows very recently hurled a
log of wood at a poor Gipsy child&rsquo;s head for an offence
which we could not learn, farther than it was for a trifling
affair; fortunately, it missed the poor child&rsquo;s head, or
death must have been the result.&nbsp; In visiting an encampment
last autumn I came across six Gipsy children having their dinner
off three small boiled turnips, and drinking the water as broth;
the eldest girl, although dressed in rags, was going to sit the
same afternoon for a leading artist upon a throne as a Spanish
queen.&nbsp; In another part of London&mdash;<!-- page 280--><a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>Mary
Place&mdash;I found a family of Gipsies living under sticks and
rags in the most filthy, sickening, and disgusting backyard I
have ever been into&mdash;to such an extent was the stench that
immediately I came out of it I had to get a little brandy or I
should have fainted&mdash;the eldest girl of whom had her time
pretty fully taken up by sitting as an artist&rsquo;s model in
the costume of a peasant girl, sometimes gathering buttercups and
daisies, at other times gathering roses and making button-holes
for gentlemen&rsquo;s coats and placing them there with gentle
hands and a smiling face; occasionally she would be painted as a
country milk-girl driving the cows to pasture; at other times as
a young lady playing at croquet on the lawn and gambolling with
children.&nbsp; What a contrast, what a delusion! from rags to
silks and satins; from a filthy abode not fit for pigs to a
palace; from turnips and diseased bacon to wine and biscuits;
from beds of rotten straw to crimson and gold-covered chairs;
from trampling among dead cats to a carpet composed of wild
flowers; from &ldquo;Get out you wretch and fetch some money, no
matter how,&rdquo; to &ldquo;Come here, my dear, is there
anything I can do for you?&rdquo; from the stench of a cesspool
to the fragrance of the honeysuckle and sweetbriar, in one word,
from hell to heaven all in an hour&mdash;such is one side of
Gipsy life among the little Gipsies, not one of whom can read a
sentence or write one word, and it is in this way Gipsy girls are
found exposing their bodies to keep their big, healthy brothers
and fathers at home in idleness and sin.&nbsp; Two such Gipsy
girls have come under my own notice, and no doubt there are
scores of similar cases.&nbsp; Gipsy children are fond of a great
degree of heat, and sometimes lie so near to the coke fires as to
be in danger of burning.&nbsp; I have seen them with their faces
as red as if they were upon the point of being roasted, and yet
they can bear to travel in the severest cold bare-headed, with no
other covering than some old rags carelessly thrown over
them.&nbsp; The cause of their bodily qualities, at least some of
them, arises from their education and hardy manner of life.&nbsp;
<!-- page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>Formerly the Gipsies, when there was less English blood
in their veins, could stand the extreme changes and hardships of
the English climate much better than now.&nbsp; An Englishman,
notwithstanding the fact that he has let go all moral and social
respect and restraint over his conduct and joined the Gipsies,
does not, and cannot, thrive and look well under their manner of
living, and this I see more and more every day.&nbsp; I have been
struck very forcibly lately in visiting some of the hordes of
Gipsies with the vast number of children the Gipsies bring into
the world and the few that are reared.&nbsp; At one encampment
there were forty men and women and only about the same number of
children to be seen.&nbsp; At another encampment I found double
the quantity of children to adult Gipsies.</p>

</a></p>
<p>No one can deny the fact that some of the children look well,
but, on the other hand, a vast number look quite the reverse of
this, pictures of starvation, neglect, bad blood, and
cruelty.&nbsp; An Englishman is born for a nobler purpose than to
lead a vagabond&rsquo;s life and end his days in scratching among
filth and vermin in a Gipsy&rsquo;s wigwam, consequently, upon
those of our own countrymen who have forsaken the right path, the
sin attending such a course is dogging them at every footstep
they take.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t lay at the door of their wigwam
the sin of child-stealing, but this I have seen, <i>i.e.</i>,
many strange-looking children in their tents without the least
shadow of a similarity to the adults in either habits,
appearance, manner, or conversation.&nbsp; Some of the poor
things seemed shy and reserved, and quite out of their
element.&nbsp; Sometimes the thought has occurred to me that they
were the children of sin, and put out of the way to escape shame
being painted upon the back of their parents.&nbsp; Sometimes my
pity for the poor things has led me to put a question or two
bearing upon the subject to the Gipsies, and the answer has been,
&ldquo;The poor things have lost their father and
mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; When I have asked if the fathers and mothers
were Gipsies a little hesitation was manifested, and the subject
<!-- page 282--><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>dropped with no satisfactory answer to my mind.&nbsp; I
have my own idea about the matter.</p>
<p>The hardships the women have to undergo are most
heartrending.&nbsp; The mother, in order to procure a morsel of
food, takes her three months&rsquo; old child either in her arms
or on her back, and wanders the streets or lanes in foul or fair
weather&mdash;in heat or cold.&nbsp; Some of them have told me
that they walk on an average over twelves miles a day.&nbsp; They
are the bread-winners.&nbsp; I have seen them on their return to
their wigwams, in the depth of winter, with six inches of snow on
the ground, and scantily clad, and with six little children
crying round them for bread.&nbsp; No fire in the tent, and her
husband idling about in other tents.&nbsp; In cases of
confinements, the men have to do something, or they would all
starve.&nbsp; For a few days they wake up out of their idle
dreams.&nbsp; I know of Gipsy women who have trudged along with
their loads, and their children at their heels, to within the
last five minutes of their confinement.&nbsp; The children were
literally born under the hedge bottom, and without any tent or
protection whatever.&nbsp; A Gipsy woman told me a week or two
since that her mother had told her that she was born under the
hedge bottom in Bagworth Lane, in Leicestershire.&nbsp; When I
questioned her on the subject, she rather gloried in the fact
that they had not time to stick the tent-sticks into the
ground.&nbsp; This kind of disgraceful procedure is not far
removed from that of animals.&nbsp; I should think that I am
speaking within compass when I state that two-thirds of the
Gipsies travelling about the country have been born under what
they call the &ldquo;hedge bottom,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, in tents
and like places.&nbsp; The Gipsy women use no cradles; the child,
as a rule, sleeps on the ground.&nbsp; When a boy attains three
years of age, so says Hoyland, the rags he was wrapped in are
thrown on one side, and he is equally exposed with the parents to
the severest weather.&nbsp; He is then put to trial to see how
far his legs will carry him.&nbsp; Clayton told me that when he
was a boy of about twelve, his father sent <!-- page 283--><a
name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>him into
the town and among the villages&mdash;with no other covering upon
him only a piece of an old shirt&mdash;to bring either bread or
money home, no matter how.</p>
<p>Among some of the State projects put forth in Hungary more
than a century since to improve the condition of the Gipsies, the
following may be mentioned: (1) They were prohibited from
dwelling in huts and tents, from wandering up and down the
country, from dealing in horses, from eating animals which died
of themselves and carrion.&nbsp; (2) They were to be called New
Boors instead of Gipsies, and they were not to converse in any
other language but that of any of the countries in which they
chose to reside.&nbsp; (3) After some months from the passing of
the Act, they were to quit their Gipsy manner of life and settle,
like the other inhabitants, in cities or villages, and to provide
themselves with suitable and proper clothing.&nbsp; (4) No Gipsy
was allowed to marry who could not prove himself in a condition
to provide for and maintain a wife and children.&nbsp; (5) That
from such Gipsies who were married and had families, the children
should be taken away by force, removed from their parents,
relations, or intercourse with the Gipsy race, and to have a
better education given to them.&nbsp; At Fahlendorf, in
Sch&uuml;tt, and in the district of Prassburg, all the children
of the New Boors (Gipsies) above five years old were carried away
in waggons on the night of the twenty-first of December, 1773, by
overseers appointed for that purpose, in order, that, at a
distance from their parents or relations, they might be more
usefully educated and sent to work.&nbsp; (6) They were to be
taught the principles of religion, and their children
educated.&nbsp; Their children were prohibited running about
their houses, streets, or roads naked, and they were not to be
allowed to sleep promiscuously by each other without distinction
of sex.&nbsp; (7) They were enjoined to attend church regularly,
and to give proof of their Christian disposition, and they were
not to wear large cloaks, which were chiefly used to hide the
<!-- page 284--><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>things they had stolen.&nbsp; (8) They were to be kept
to agriculture, and were only to be permitted to amuse themselves
with music when their day&rsquo;s work was finished.&nbsp; (9)
The magistrates at every place were to be very attentive to see
that no Gipsy wasted his time in idleness, and whoever was remiss
in his work was to be liable to corporal punishment.</p>
<p>All these suggestions and plans of operation may not suit
English life; be that as it may, they were suitable to the
condition of the Hungarian Gipsies, and no doubt laid the
foundation for the improvement that has taken place among
them.&nbsp; The Hungarian Gipsies are educated, and are tillers
of the soil.&nbsp; If a plan similar in some respects had been
carried out with our Gipsies at the same period, we should not by
this time have had a Gipsy-tent in the country, or an uneducated
Gipsy in our land.&nbsp; What a different aspect would have
presented itself ere this, if the 5,000 Gipsies among us had been
tilling our waste lands and commons for the last century.&nbsp;
With proper management, these 5,000 Gipsy men could have bought
and kept under cultivation some 20,000 acres of land for the
well-being of themselves and for the good of the country.&nbsp;
There is neglect, indifference, and apathy somewhere.&nbsp; The
blame will lay heavily upon some one when the accounts are made
up.</p>
<p>It is appalling and humiliating to think that we, as a
Christian nation, should have had in our midst for more than
three centuries 15,000 to 20,000 poor ignorant Asiatic heathens,
naturally sharp and clever, and next to nothing being done to
reclaim them from their worse than midnight darkness.&nbsp; A
heavy sin and responsibility lays at our doors.&nbsp; Take away
John Bunyan, a few of the Smiths, Palmers, Lovells, Lees, Hearns,
Coopers, Simpsons, Boswells, Eastwoods, Careys, Roberts, &amp;c.,
and what do we find?&mdash;a black army of human beings who have
done next to nothing&mdash;comparatively speaking&mdash;for the
country&rsquo;s good.&nbsp; They have cadged at our doors, lived
on our commons, worn our <!-- page 285--><a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>roads, been
fed from our tables, sent their paupers to our workhouses, their
idiots to our asylums, and not contributed one farthing to their
maintenance and support.&nbsp; Rates and taxes are unknown to
them.&nbsp; There is only one instance of them paying rates for
their vans, and that is at Blackpool.</p>
<p>It is a black, burning shame and disgrace to see herds of
healthy-looking girls and great strapping youths growing up in
ignorance and idleness, not so much as exerting themselves to
wash the filth off their bodies or make anything better than
skewers.&nbsp; Their highest ambition is to learn slang, roll in
the ditch, spread small-pox and fevers, threaten vengeance, and
carry out revenge upon those who attempt to frustrate their evil
designs.&nbsp; Excepting skewers, clothes-pegs, and a few other
little things of this kind, they have not manufactured anything;
the highest state of perfection they have arrived at is to be
able to make and tie up a bundle of skewers, split a clothes-peg,
tinker a kettle, mend a chair, see-saw on an old fiddle, rap
their knuckles on a tambourine, clatter about with their feet,
tickle the guitar, and make a squeaking noise through their
teeth, that fiction and romance call singing.&nbsp; The most that
can be said in their favour is, that a few of them have become
respectable Christians and hard-working men and women, and have
done something for the country&rsquo;s good&mdash;and whose fault
is it that there are not more?&nbsp; They have been the agents of
hell, working out Satan&rsquo;s designs, and we have stood by
laughing and admiring their so-called pretty faces, scarlet
cloaks, and &ldquo;witching eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the life of me
I can find no more bewitching beauty among them than can be found
in our back slums any day, circumstances considered&mdash;and
where does the blame lay?&mdash;upon our own shoulders for not
paying more attention to the education and welfare of their
children.&nbsp; It is truly horrible to think that we have had
15,000 to 20,000 young and old Gipsies at work, carrying out the
designs of the infernal regions at the tip end of the roots of
our national life, vigour, and Christianity.</p>
<p><!-- page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>Only the other day the country was much shocked, and
rightly so, at a hundred poor Russian emigrants landing upon our
shores; and yet we have two hundred times this quantity of
Gipsies among us, and we quietly stand by and take no notice of
their wretched condition.&nbsp; The time will come, and that
speedily, when we shall have the scales taken off our eyes, and
the thin, flimsy veil of romance torn to shreds.&nbsp; Sitting by
and admiring their &ldquo;pretty faces&rdquo; and &ldquo;witching
eyes&rdquo; will not save their souls, educate their children, or
put them in the way of earning an honest livelihood.&nbsp; It is
not pity&mdash;whining, sycophantic pity&mdash;alone that will do
them good.&nbsp; The Rev. Mr. Cobbin&rsquo;s Gipsy&rsquo;s
petition, written fifty years ago,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh! ye who have tasted of mercy and
love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shared in the blessings of pardoning grace,<br
/>
Let us the kind fruits of your tenderness prove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pity, oh! pity, the poor Gipsy race.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>has been little better than beating the air, and it may be
repeated a thousand times, but if nothing further is done more
than &ldquo;pity,&rdquo; the Gipsies will be worse off in fifty
years hence than they are now, nor will presenting to them bread,
cheese, ale, blankets, stockings, and a dry sermon, as Mr. Crabb
did half a century ago, render them permanent help.&nbsp; We must
do as the eagle does with her young: we must cause a little
fluster among them, so that they may begin to flounder for
themselves.&nbsp; Take them up, turn them out, and teach them to
use their own wings, and the schoolmaster and sanitary officers
are the agencies to do it.&nbsp; The men are clever and can get
money sufficient to keep their families comfortable even at
skewer-making and chair-mending, &amp;c., if they will only
work.&nbsp; All the police-officer must do will be to take charge
of those who prefer to fall to the ground rather than to struggle
for life with its attendant pleasures and enjoyments.&nbsp; The
State has taken in hand a more dangerous class&mdash;perhaps the
most dangerous&mdash;in <!-- page 287--><a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>India,
viz., the Thugs, and is teaching them useful trades and honest
industry with most encouraging results.&nbsp; Before the
Government tackled them, they were idling, loafing, rambling, and
robbing all over the country, alike to our Gipsies; now they have
settled down and become useful and good citizens.&nbsp; In Norway
the Gipsies are put into prison, and there kept till they have
learnt to read and write.&nbsp; In Hungary the Government has
appointed a special Minister to look after them, and see that
they are being properly educated and brought up.&nbsp; In Russia,
the laws passed for their imprisonment has had the effect of
causing them, to a great extent, to settle down to useful trades,
and they are forming themselves into colonies.&nbsp; And so, in
like manner, in Spain, Germany, France, and other European
countries, steps have been taken to bring about an improvement
among them.&nbsp; In these countries nearly the whole of the
Gipsies can read and write; and we, of all others, who ought to
have set the example a century ago in the way of educating the
Gipsy children, have stood by with folded arms, and let them
drift into ruin.&nbsp; I claim it to be our duty&mdash;and it
will be to our shame if we do not&mdash;to see to the welfare of
the Gipsy children for four reasons.&nbsp; First, that they are
Indians, and under the rule of our noble Queen; second, that they
are in our midst, and ought to take their share of the blessings,
duties, and responsibilities pertaining to the rest of the
community; third, that as a Christian nation, professing to lead
the van and to set forth the blessings of Christianity and
civilisation; and, fourth, their universal desire for the
education of their children, and to contribute their quota,
however small, to the country&rsquo;s good, and for the eternal
welfare of their own children; and I do not think that there will
be any objection on their part to it being brought about on the
plan I have briefly sketched out.</p>
<p>I fancy I can hear some of the artists who have been delighted
with Gipsy models&mdash;the novelists who have hung many a tale
upon the skirts of their garments&mdash;the <!-- page 288--><a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>dramatists
who have trotted them before the curtain to please the public,
and some old-fashioned croakers, who delight in allowing things
to be as they have always been&mdash;the same yesterday, to-day,
and for ever&mdash;saying, &ldquo;let everybody look after their
own children;&rdquo; and then, in a plaintive tone,
singing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Woodman, spare that tree!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Touch not a single bough;<br />
In youth it sheltered me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll protect it now.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First,&mdash;I would have all movable or temporary
habitations, used as dwellings, registered, numbered, and the
name and address of the owner or occupier painted in a prominent
place on the outside, <i>i.e.</i>, on all tents, Gipsy vans,
auctioneers&rsquo; vans, showmen&rsquo;s vans, and like places,
and under proper sanitary arrangements in a manner analogous to
the Canal Boats Act of 1877.</p>
<p>Second,&mdash;Not less than one hundred cubic feet of space
for each female above the age of twelve, and each male above the
age of fourteen; and not less than fifty cubic feet of space for
each female young person under the age of twelve, and for each
male under the age of fourteen.</p>
<p>Third,&mdash;No male above the age of fourteen, and no female
above the age of twelve, should be allowed to sleep in the same
tent or van as man and wife, unless separate sleeping
accommodation be provided for each male of the age of fourteen,
and for each female of the age of twelve; and also with proper
regard for partitions and suitable ventilation.</p>
<p>Fourth,&mdash;A registration certificate to be obtained,
renewable at any of the offices of the Urban or Rural sanitary
authorities throughout the country, for which the owner or
occupier of the tent or van should pay the sum of ten shillings
annually, commencing on the first of January in each year.</p>
<p>Fifth,&mdash;The compulsory attendance at school of all <!--
page 289--><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>travelling children, or others living in temporary or
unrateable dwellings, up to the age required by the Elementary
Education Acts, which attendance should be facilitated and
brought about by means of a school pass-book, in which the
children&rsquo;s names, ages, and grade could be entered, and
which pass-book could be made applicable to children living and
working on canal-boats, and also to other wandering
children.&nbsp; The pass-book to be easily procurable at any
bookseller&rsquo;s for the sum of one shilling.</p>
<p>Sixth,&mdash;The travelling children should be at liberty to
go to either National, British, Board, or other schools, under
the management of a properly-qualified schoolmaster, and which
schoolmaster should sign the children&rsquo;s pass-book, showing
the number of times the children had attended school during their
temporary stay.</p>
<p>Seventh,&mdash;The cost for the education of these wandering
children should be paid by the guardians of the poor out of the
poor rates, a proper account being kept by the schoolmaster and
delivered to the parochial authorities quarterly.</p>
<p>Eighth,&mdash;Power to be given to any properly-qualified
sanitary officer, School Board visitor or inspector, to enter the
tents, vans, canal-boats, or other movable or temporary
habitations, at any time or in any place, and detain, if
necessary, for the purpose of seeing that the law was being
properly carried out; and any one obstructing such officer in his
duty, and not carrying out the law, to be subject to a fine or
imprisonment for each offence.</p>
<p>Ninth,&mdash;It would be well if arrangements could be made
with lords of manors, the Government, or others who are owners of
waste lands, to grant those Gipsies who are without vans, and
living in tents only, prior to the act coming into force, a long
lease at a nominal rent of, say, half an acre or an acre of land,
for ninety-nine years, on purpose to encourage them to settle
down to the cultivation of it, and to take to honest
industry&mdash;as many of them are prepared to do.&nbsp; By this
means a number of the Gipsies would collect <!-- page 290--><a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>together on
the marshes and commons, and no doubt other useful and profitable
occupation would be the outcome of the Gipsies being thus
localised, and in which their children could and would take an
important part; and in addition to these things the social and
educational advantages to be reaped by following such a course
would be many.</p>
<p>I have not the least doubt in my mind but that if a law be
passed embodying these brief, but rough, suggestions, on the one
hand, and steps are taken to encourage them to settle down, in
accordance with the idea thrown out in clause nine, on the other,
we shall not have in fifty years hence an uneducated Gipsy in our
midst.&nbsp; Many of the Gipsies are anxious, I know, for some
steps to be taken for the children to be brought up to
work.&nbsp; The operation of the present Hawkers&rsquo; and
Pedlars&rsquo; Act is acting very detrimental to the interests of
the Gipsy children, as none are allowed to carry a licence under
the age of sixteen, consequently all Gipsy children, except a few
who assist in making pegs and skewers, are neither going to
school nor yet are they learning a trade or in fact work of any
kind; they are simply living in idleness, and under the influence
of evil training that carries mischief underneath the
surface.</p>
<p>It is truly appalling to think that over seven hundred
thousand sharp, clever, well-formed human beings, and with plenty
of muscular power, have, as I have said before, been roaming
about Europe for many centuries with no object before them, and
accomplishing nothing.&nbsp; Something like ten millions of
Gipsies have been born, lived, died, and gone into the other
world since they set foot upon European soil, and what have they
done? what work have they accomplished?&nbsp; Alas! alas! worse
than a cipher might be written against them.&nbsp; They have
lived in the midst of beauty, songsters, romance, and fiction,
and they have been surrounded by everything that would help to
call forth natural energy, mechanical skill, and ability, but
they have been in some senses like children playing in the street
gutters.&nbsp; They have <!-- page 291--><a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>the
elements of success within them, but no one has taken them by the
hand to put them upon the first step, at any rate, so far as
England is concerned.&nbsp; It is grievous to think that not one
of these ten millions of Gipsies who have gone the way of all
flesh has written a book, painted a painting, composed any
poetry, worth calling poetry, produced a minister worthy of much
note&mdash;at least, I can only hear of one or two.&nbsp; They
have fine voices as a rule, and except some half-dozen Gipsies no
first-rate musicians have sprung from their midst.&nbsp; No
engineer, no mechanic&mdash;in fact, no nothing.&nbsp; The
highest state of their manufacturing skill has been to make a few
slippers for the feet, as some of them are doing at Lynn; skewers
to stick into meat, for which they have done nothing towards
feeding; pegs to hang out other people&rsquo;s linen, some
tinkering, chair-bottoming, knife-grinding, and a little light
smith work, and a few have made a little money by
horse-dealing.&nbsp; There are others clever at &ldquo;making
shifts&rdquo; and roadside tents, and will put up with almost
anything rather than put forth much energy.&nbsp; Since the
Gipsies landed in this country more than one hundred and fifty
thousand have been born, principally, as they say, &ldquo;under
the hedge bottom,&rdquo; lived, and died.&nbsp; They are gone
&ldquo;and their works do follow them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their present
degraded condition in this country may be laid upon our
backs.</p>
<p>This book, with its many faults and few virtues, is my own as
in the case of my others, and all may be laid upon my back; and
my object in saying hard and unpalatable things about the poor,
ignorant Gipsy wanderers in our midst is not to expose them to
ridicule, or to cause the finger of scorn to be pointed at them
or to any one connected with them, but to try to influence the
hearts of my countrymen to extend the hand of practical sympathy,
and help to rescue the poor Gipsy children from dropping into the
vortex of ruin, as so many thousands have done before.&nbsp; It
is not unlikely but that I shall, in saying plain things about
the Gipsies, expose myself to some inconvenience,
misrepresentation, malice, and spite from <!-- page 292--><a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>those who
would keep the Gipsies in ignorance, and also from shadow
philanthropists, who are always on the look out for other
people&rsquo;s brains; but these things, so long as God gives me
strength, will not deter me from doing what I consider to be
right in the interest of the children, so long as I can see the
finger of Providence pointing the way, and it is to Him I must
look for the reward, &ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; which will more
than repay me for all the inconvenience I have undergone, or may
have still to undergo, in the cause of the &ldquo;little
ones.&rdquo;&nbsp; That man is no real friend to the Gipsies who
seeks to improve them by flattery and deception.&nbsp; A Gipsy,
with all his faults, likes to be dealt fairly and openly
with&mdash;a little praise but no flattery suits him.&nbsp; They
can practise cunning, but they do not care to have any one
practising it upon them.</p>
<p>I dare not be sanguine enough to hope that I shall be
successful, but I have tried thus far to show, first, the past
and present condition of the Gipsies; second, the little we, as a
nation, have done to reclaim them; and, third, what we ought to
do to improve them in the future, so as to remove the stigma from
our shoulders of having 20,000 to 30,000 Gipsies, show people,
and others living in vans, &amp;c., in our midst, fast drifting
into heathenism and barbarism, not five per cent. of whom can
read and write, at least, so far as the Gipsies are concerned;
and those children travelling with &ldquo;gingerbread&rdquo;
stalls, rifle galleries, and auctioneers are but little better,
for all the parents tell me their children lose in the summer
what little they learn at school in the winter, for the want of
means being adopted whereby their children could go to school
during the daytime as they are travelling through the country
with their wares, <i>i.e.</i>, at their halting-places.</p>
<p>In bringing this book to a close, I would say, in the name of
all that is just, fair, honourable, and reasonable, in the name
of science, religion, philosophy, and humanity, and in the name
of all that is Christ-like, God-like, and heavenly, <!-- page
293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>I
ask, nay I claim, the attention of our noble Queen&mdash;whose
deep interest in the children of the labouring population is
unbounded&mdash;statesmen, Christians, and my countrymen to the
condition of the Gipsies and their children, whose condition is
herein feebly described, and whose cause I have ventured to take
in hand, praying them to adopt measures and to pass such laws
that will wipe out the disgrace of having so many thousands of
poor, ignorant, uneducated, wretched, and lost Gipsy children in
our midst, who cannot read and write, on the following
grounds&mdash;</p>
<p>First.&nbsp; Their Indian origin, which I venture to think has
been satisfactorily proved, and over which country our Queen is
the Empress; consequently, our Gipsies ought and have as much
need to be taken in hand and their condition improved by the
State as the Thugs in India have been, with such beneficial
results, a class similar in many respects to our Gipsies.</p>
<p>Second.&nbsp; As the Government in 1877 passed an act, called
&ldquo;The Canal Boats Act,&rdquo; dealing pretty much with the
same class of people as the Gipsies and other travelling
children, they ought, in all fairness, to extend the principle to
those living in tents and vans.</p>
<p>Third.&nbsp; As small-pox, fevers, and other infectious
diseases are at times very prevalent among them&mdash;a medical
officer being called in only under the rarest occasion&mdash;and
as the tents and vans are not under any sanitary arrangements,
there is, therefore, urgent need for some sort of sanitary
supervision and control to be exercised over their wretched
habitations to prevent the spread of disease in such a stealthy
manner.</p>
<p>Fourth.&nbsp; As the Government took steps some three
centuries ago to class the Gipsies as rogues and vagabonds, but
took no steps at the same time to improve their condition or even
to encourage them to get upon the right paths for leading an
honourable and industrious life, the time has now come, I think,
both in justice and equity, for <!-- page 294--><a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>the
Government to adopt some means to catch the young hedge-bottom
&ldquo;Bob Rats,&rdquo; and to deal out to them measures that
will Christianise and civilise them to such an extent that the
Gipsies will not in the future be deserving of the epithets
passed upon them by the Government for their sins of omission and
commission.</p>
<p>Fifth.&nbsp; By passing an Act of Parliament, as I suggest, or
amending the Canal Boats Act, in accordance with the plan I have
laid down, and embodying the suggestions herein contained, the
Government will complete the educational system and bring under
the educational and sanitary laws the lowest dregs of society,
which have hitherto been left out in the cold, to grope about in
the dark as their inclinations might lead them.</p>
<p>Sixth.&nbsp; The families who are seeking a living as hawkers,
show people, &amp;c., apart from the Gipsies, are on the
increase.&nbsp; By travelling up and down the country in this way
they not only escape rates and taxes, but their children are
going without education, as no provision is made in the education
acts to meet cases of this kind.&nbsp; By bringing the Gipsy
children under the influence of the schoolmaster our law-makers
will be adding the last stroke to the system of compulsory
education introduced and carried into law through its first
difficult and intricate phases by the Right Hon. W. E. Forster,
M.P., when he was at the head of the Education Department under
the Liberal Government, and through its second stages by the
Right Hon. Lord Sandon, M.P., when he was at the head of the
Education Department under the Conservative Government.</p>
<p>Seventh.&nbsp; There is an universal desire among people of
the classes I have before referred to for the education of their
children, in fact, I have not met with one exception during my
inquiries, and the Gipsies will be glad to make some sacrifices
to carry it out if the Government will do their part in the
matter.</p>
<p>Eighth.&nbsp; The Gipsies and other travellers of the same
<!-- page 295--><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>kind use our roads, locate on our commons, live in our
lanes, and send their poor, halt, maimed, and blind to our
workhouses, infirmaries, and asylums, towards the support of
which they do not contribute one farthing.</p>
<p>Ninth.&nbsp; As a Christian nation professing to send the
Gospel all over the world, to preach glad tidings, peace upon
earth and good-will towards men everywhere, to take steps for the
conversion of the Gipsies in India, the African, the Chinese, the
South Sea Islander, the Turk, the black, the white, the bond, the
free, in fact everywhere where an Englishman goes the Gospel is
supposed to go too, and yet&mdash;and it is with sadness, sorrow,
and shame I relate it&mdash;we have had on an average during the
last three hundred and sixty-five years not less than 15,000
Gipsies moving among us, and not less than 150,000 have died and
been buried, either under water, in the ditches, or on the
roadside, on the commons, or in the cemeteries or churchyards,
and we, as Christians of Christian England, have not spent
150,000 pence to reclaim the adult Gipsies, or to educate their
children.</p>
<p>Tenth.&nbsp; As a civilised country we are supposed to lead
the van in civilising the world by passing the most humane,
righteous, just, and liberal laws, carrying them out on the plan
of tempering justice with mercy; but in matters concerning the
interests and welfare of the Gipsies we are, as I have shown
previously, a long way in the rear.&nbsp; We have passed laws to
improve the condition of the agricultural labourer&rsquo;s child,
children working in mines, children working in factories,
performing boys, climbing boys, children working in brick-yards,
children working and living on canal-boats, and a thousand
others; but we have done nothing for the poor Gipsy child or its
home.&nbsp; In things pertaining to their present and eternal
welfare they have asked for bread and we have given them a stone;
and they have asked for fish and we have given them a
serpent.&nbsp; We have allowed them to wander and lose themselves
in the dark wilds of sin and <!-- page 296--><a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>iniquity
without shedding upon their path the light of Gospel truths or
the blessings of education; and to-day the Gipsy children are
dying, where thousands have died before, among the brambles and
in the thicket of bad example, ignorance, and evil training, into
which we have allowed them to stray blinded by the evil
associations of Gipsy life.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;An aged woman walks along,<br />
Her piercing scream is on the air,<br />
Her head and streaming locks are bare,<br />
She sadly sobs &lsquo;My child, my child!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A faint voice is heard in the distance calling out&mdash;</p>

<h3>THE LIFE OF GEORGE SMITH,<br />
OF COALVILLE.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The name of George Smith, of Coalville, is familiar as
household words, and the unpretending memoir just published by
Messrs. Haughton &amp; Co. of him, to whose deep sympathy and
ceaseless effort the populations of our brick-yards and canals
owe so much, will be read with interest by
all.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Graphic</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Readers of Mr. Smith&rsquo;s letters in numerous
papers, and of his descriptive articles in the <i>Illustrated
London News</i>, <i>Graphic</i>, and other journals and
magazines, will be glad to possess this little work, which tells
the story of his career in a brief but interesting manner.&nbsp;
The book is elegantly printed on good paper, and is embellished
with an excellent portrait and with an engraving of Mr. Smith
among the Gipsy children.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Capital and
Labour</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is &lsquo;a chapter&rsquo; in philanthropy, yet it
contains three times as much in the way of practical philanthropy
as would suffice to make any man a benefactor to his
generation.&nbsp; His devoted, self-denying, persistent, and
successful endeavours on behalf of the brick-yard children, the
canal population, and more recently the Gipsy
&lsquo;arabs,&rsquo; of our country and time, are concisely and
vividly set forth in this neat volume.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
Christian</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name of George Smith, and his noble work amongst
the canal-boat folk and the Gipsies, have become familiar and
welcome to multitudes in Great Britain.&nbsp; This volume is an
excellent sketch of Mr. Smith; it contains a capital likeness,
and should be read by all who desire to possess increasing zeal
in rescuing the perishing.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian Age</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A smartly written biography of a man who may be justly
termed the Children&rsquo;s Friend.&nbsp; It is well got up, and
contains an excellent portrait of the great social
reformer.&nbsp; It is well that this fascinating sketch should be
given to the world.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Literary World</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this book we are presented with a sketch of the life
and labours&mdash;labours which have been attended with a large
measure of success&mdash;of one of the most devoted of living
philanthropists.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Scotsman</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine biography, which every one should read in order
to understand the noble character of a man who must be pronounced
a great benefactor.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Free Press</i>.</p>

class="smcap">with remedy</span>.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">New Edition, with Supplement.<br />
By GEORGE SMITH, F.S.A., Coalville, Leicester.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little book called &lsquo;Our Canal
Population,&rsquo; lately published and written by Mr. George
Smith, of Coalville, furnishes the most incredible details of
what is going on on our silent highways.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Morning
Advertiser</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The notorious state of &lsquo;Our Canal
Population,&rsquo; the women and children who live on barges, and
in whose condition Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, has awakened
public interest, is described as &lsquo;revolting and
intolerable.&rsquo;&nbsp; If only a part of the statements made
were true it would be enough to make the ears of them that hear
it tingle for pity and shame.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Daily News</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although the statements made by Mr. George Smith, of
Coalville, in &lsquo;Our Canal Population,&rsquo; were doubtless,
in some instances, open to the charge of exaggeration, in the
main they were largely correct.&nbsp; Mr. Smith has earned the
thanks of the community in this philanthropic object, as he
previously earned our thanks for his efforts to ameliorate the
condition of children in the
brick-yards.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Standard</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canal Boats.&mdash;On the 1st inst. came into operation
an Act (the 40 and 41 Vic., c. 60) which is calculated to do much
good.&nbsp; Hitherto &lsquo;Our Canal Population&rsquo; were left
pretty much to themselves.&nbsp; They were considered outside the
pale of local and educational authorities.&nbsp; They were
permitted to live in their boats as they pleased, and to bring up
their children without any interference from school
authorities.&nbsp; Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, whose efforts
on behalf of the children employed in brick-fields were attended
with such beneficial results, turned his attention to &lsquo;Our
Canal Population,&rsquo; and the credit likely to be won by the
passing of the Act of last Session will be mainly
his.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Times</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, who has done so much
for the well-being of &lsquo;Our Canal Population,&rsquo; is now
busied in attempts to ameliorate the condition of juvenile
Gipsies.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Daily Telegraph</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This gentleman represents by name, at least, a very
large family, but he has won for himself considerable distinction
among the &lsquo;Smiths&rsquo; for his unparalleled efforts to
ameliorate the wretched condition of &lsquo;Our Canal
Population&rsquo; on the English canals, the women and children
working in the brick-yards, and the Gipsy
children.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian Herald</i>.</p>

who sympathise with childhood, whose hearts bleed at the story of
its wrongs and leap for joy at any humane or beneficial measures
on its behalf.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Sunday School Chronicle</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His cry for the protection for the helpless little ones
is one that must assuredly command
attention.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This book is the record of a splendid service nobly
done.&nbsp; The author is likewise the hero of it.&nbsp; The
value of the book is enhanced by the careful and tasteful manner
in which Messrs. Haughton have fulfilled their share of the
undertaking.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Derby Reporter</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Smith writes with vehement energy, which he puts
into everything he does.&nbsp; Some will perhaps think that his
language is occasionally too little measured, but then it is
probable that a man of more delicacy of feeling and expression
would have never undertaken, and we think it is certain that he
would never have carried through, the work which Mr. George Smith
has accomplished.&nbsp; That work is of no small
value.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Staffordshire Sentinel</i>.</p>

class="footnote">[8]</a>&nbsp; Since writing the foregoing
concerning Mahmood or Mahmud, I came across the enclosed, taken
from an article in the <i>Daily News</i>, January 11, 1880, which
confirms my statements as regards one of the main causes why the
Gipsies or Indians left their native
country:&mdash;&ldquo;Ghuznee was the capital of Mahmud of
Ghuznee, or Mahmud the Destroyer, as he is known in Eastern
story, the first of the Mohammedan conquerors of India, and the
only one who had his home in Afghanistan, though he was himself
of Turki or Mongol nationality.&nbsp; Seventeen times did he
issue forth from his native mountains, spreading fire and sword
over the plains of Hindustan, westward as far as the Ganges
Valley, and southward to the shore of Gujerat.&nbsp; Seventeen
times did he return to Ghuznee laden with the spoil of Rajput
kings and the shrines of Hindu pilgrimage.&nbsp; In one of these
expeditions his goal was the far-famed temple of Somnauth or
Somnauth Patan in Gujerat.&nbsp; Resistance was vain, and equally
useless were the tears of the Brahmins, who besought him to take
their treasures, but at least spare their idol.&nbsp; With his
own hand, and with the mace which is the counterpart of Excalibar
in Oriental legend, he smote the face of the idol, and a torrent
of precious stones gushed out.&nbsp; When Keane&rsquo;s army took
Ghuznee in 1839, this mace was still to be seen hanging up over
the sarcophagus of Mahmud, and the tomb was then entered through
folding gates, which tradition asserted to be those of the Temple
of Somnauth.&nbsp; Lord Ellenborough gave instructions to General
Nott to bring back with him to India both the mace and the
gates.&nbsp; The latter, as is well-known, now lie mouldering in
the lumber-room of the fort at Agra, for their authenticity is
absolutely indefensible; but the mace could nowhere be found by
the British plunderer.&nbsp; Mahmud reigned from 997 to 1030
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, and in his days Ghuznee was
probably the first city in Asia.&nbsp; The extensive ruins of his
city stretch northwards along the Cabul road for more than two
miles from the present town; but all that now remains standing
are two lofty pillars or minarets, 400 yards apart, one bearing
the name of Mahmud, the other that of his son Masaud.&nbsp;
Beyond these ruins again is the Roza or Garden, which surrounds
the mausoleum of Mahmud.&nbsp; The building itself is a poor
structure, and can hardly date back for eight centuries.&nbsp;
The great conqueror is said to rest beneath a marble slab, which
bears an inscription in Cufic characters, thus interpreted by
Major (now Sir Henry) Rawlinson: &lsquo;May there be forgiveness
of God upon him, who is the great lord, the noble Nizam-ud-din
(Ruler of the Faith) Abul Kasim Mahmud, the son of
Sabaktagin!&nbsp; May God have mercy upon him!&rsquo;&nbsp; The
Ghuznevide dynasty founded by Mahmud lasted for more than a
century after his death, though with greatly restricted
dominions.&nbsp; Finally, it was extinguished in 1152 by one of
those awful acts of atrocity which are fortunately recorded only
in the East.&nbsp; Allah-ud-din, Prince of Ghore, a town in the
north-western hills of Afghanistan, marched upon Ghuznee to
avenge the death of two of his brothers.&nbsp; The king was slain
in battle, and the city given up to be sacked.&nbsp; The common
orders of the people were all massacred upon the spot; the nobles
were taken to Ghore, and there put to death, and their blood used
to cement the rising walls of the capital.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote176"></a><a href="#citation176"
class="footnote">[176]</a>&nbsp; The &ldquo;Czardas&rdquo; is a
solitary public-house, an institution which plays a considerable
part in all romantic poems or romantic novels whose scene is laid
in Hungary, as a fitting haunt for brigands, horse-thieves,
Gipsies, Jews, political refugees, strolling players, vagabond
poets, and other melodramatic personages.</p>

my mind, to be in accord with his doing no work for years,
smoking under railroad arches and loitering about
beershops.&nbsp; I expect, if the truth were known, the whole of
his furniture and stock-in-trade could have been placed upon a
wheelbarrow.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
